Fundamentals of Life
====================

This contains fundamental ideas about life, such as what it is, how to improve it, and what it can be. It is my hope that this can serve as a guide to live a fulfilling life for those without proper parental guidance.

Why
===

That's the most important question. Why read this? In short, because it is just a single page that contains the essential things that everyone should know to live a good life in the right way.

There are a lot of information on the Internet, in books, on TV, from family/friends, etc about how to have a happy and successful life, like good career and loving family, but all of them are scattered across different places. Access to all sources may not be readily available. This is intended to be a single source that contains all the essential concepts from everywhere and everyone. External links might be used to get more details for the insatiables, but essential ideas will be here, so there is no need to look elsewhere to get your life started in the right direction.

Motivation
==========

Just a bit of history to understand why I wrote this.

I grew up with little parental guidance and learned everything from TV, school, other people, trial/error, etc, and always wished that I had someone that had a full life experience to guide me in the right direction to avoid many of the common mistakes that I had made. It took me 36 years to finally realize what life is all about, so I am hoping to save others some time by sharing.

As a parent now, I am glad that I can help my children grow, but I can also see other people going through the same thing that I had without any guidance, hence this could fill in some of that gap -- if they find it, LOL (hint: please share with your friends/family).

As a software engineer, I am always thinking about redundancy, and hence this would serve as a backup for my kids in case I am gone.

Advice for Different Stages of Life
===================================

Child
-----

This is a great time to have fun as everything is new and exciting, so do savor the moments. Aside from having fun, it is also a great time to learn different skills that can accelerate latter stages of life. The brain just soaks up everything so easily, so why not.

Teenager
--------

A lot of hormones at work during this time to develop the body. Just let the body do its magic, but don't let it take over decision making. Always use your mind. Learn and experience everything that life has to offer with some care -- as long as you keep a healthy body and mind, everything is a go. 

School dominates this stage. Always be learning, but don't just do it, it's important to develop a love for learning. That is what separates those that will have a successful/easy life and those that don't.

Adult
-----

The final stage of life is also the beginning of the real life. The earlier stages are just prepration of the body and mind. This is where we can start to make a difference and really live the life that we want.
