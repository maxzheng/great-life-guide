Fundamentals of Life
====================

This contains fundamental ideas about life, such as what it is, how to improve it, and what it can be. It is my hope that this can serve as a guide to live a fulfilling life for those without proper parental guidance.

Why
===

That's the most important question. Why read this? In short, because it is just a single page that contains the essential things that everyone should know to live a good life in the right way.

There are a lot of information on the Internet, in books, on TV, from family/friends, etc about how to have a happy and successful life, like good career and loving family, but all of them are scattered across different places. Access to all sources may not be readily available. This is intended to be a single source that contains all the essential concepts from everywhere and everyone. External links might be used to get more details for the insatiables, but essential ideas will be here, so there is no need to look elsewhere to get your life started in the right direction.

Motivation
==========

Just a bit of history to understand why I wrote this.

I grew up with little parental guidance and learned everything from TV, school, other people, trial/error, etc, and always wished that I had someone that had a full life experience to guide me in the right direction to avoid many of the common mistakes that I had made. It took me 36 years to finally realize what life is all about, so I am hoping to save others some time by sharing.

As a parent now, I am glad that I can help my children grow, but I can also see other people going through the same thing that I had without any guidance, hence this could fill in some of that gap -- if they find it, LOL (hint: please share with your friends/family).

As a software engineer, I am always thinking about redundancy, and hence this would serve as a backup for my kids in case I am gone.

Advice for Different Stages of Life
===================================

Child
-----

This is a great time to have fun as everything is new and exciting, so do savor the moments. Aside from having fun, it is also a great time to learn different skills that can accelerate latter stages of life. The brain just soaks up everything so easily, so why not.

Teen
----

A lot of hormones at work during this time to develop the body. Just let the body do its magic, but don't let it take over decision making. Always use your mind. Learn and experience everything that life has to offer with some care -- as long as you keep a healthy body and mind, everything is a go. 

School dominates this stage. Always be learning, but don't just do it, it's important to develop a love for learning. That is what separates those that will have a successful/easy life and those that don't.

Adult
-----

The final stage of life is also the beginning of the real life. The earlier stages are just prepration of the body and mind. This is where you can start to make a difference and really live the life that you want.

Around 40 years old, the body and mind start to decline, so more effort is required to maintain health.

Vision, Mission, and Goals
==========================

The first 20 years of life is mostly spent on learning and exploring. After that, it's important to know what you want out of life so you can iteratively attain them.

A vision paints a future world that you want your children to live in. This serves as a true north for everything that you do. E.g. world peace, or deprecation of poverty, or everyone is happy. This should inspire you.

A mission describes how you want to achieve the vision. This can change over time as you learn, but should be the single most importannt thing that you are trying to do. E.g. I want to continuously improve myself to reach my full potential and help others to do the same, so together we can do great things.

And finally, there can be many goals in your life, such as getting married, having kids, or have a great career.

Guiding Principles
==================

Life can be complicated as there are so many choices and so many variables (people) involved. To help achieve your vision, mission, and goals in the fastest and safest way, follow these two guiding principles. 

1. Do the right thing
2. Be rock solid

Do the right thing is the fastest way to get what you want as the wrong way requires redo and some things can not be undone.

Be rock solid is the safest way as there are many challenges and bad actors that will block you so it's important to believe in yourself, stand firmly behind your ideas, and never waver -- like a rock. 

There is a balance between the two principles. Doing the right thing without being rock solid will result in a mental breakdown. Being rock solid without doing the right thing is simply stubborn and wastes a lot of time.

Continuous Improvement
======================

To iteratively get closer to your vision and goals, follow these 5 simple steps to continously improve yourself:

1. Life is a game, so relax and have fun!
2. Set intentions based on your vision, mission, and goals. 
3. Be mindful of the present with acceptance.
4. Do the right thing.
5. Be rock solid.

Each step has a distinct purpose. The default state of your mind should be step #3 -- be mindful of the present with acceptance.

Essential Skills
================

It's not enough to train the body or mind, but both are required to get the optimal performance. 

The saying "if you don't use it, you will loose it" applies to both body and mind. And both deterioates with age, and so it is important to train more and consistently.

Body
----

Exercise daily at least 30 minutes a day. Any form of exercise is fine, but yoga trains BESF (Balance, Endurance, Strenth, and Flexibility) and so is recommended. 

Mind
----

There are many areas to train, here are some of the key ones:

1. Meditate mindfully to clear the mind and train attention, which improves utilization of memory and cognitive processing. This also helps with awareness of emotions and other states of the body and mind, which helps to keep them in check and to maximize their use for your benefits.
2. Read daily to learn new things to keep the mind interested and active. The entire human knowledge is written in books or on the Internet, which took thousands of years from billions of people to create, so leverage them to save yourself the time and avoid the same mistakes.
3. Always be asking the hard questions -- why, what, how -- but try to answer them yourself first before asking others, so you become smarter.
4. Think about what you can do to make things better for you and everyone. Creativity wins over everything else in the long run.
5. Love what you do and be motivated by keeping `PPP (Play, Purpose, Potential) <https://hbr.org/2015/11/how-company-culture-shapes-employee-motivation>`_ in mind for everything that you do. Play is where you enjoy what you do and is the most powerful motivator. Purpose is what you get after you do something. Potential is what you might be able to do in the future after you have done it. 
6. Be a `transcendent leader <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/become-transcendent-leader-reid-hoffman>`_ that follows the mission, not other people, and inspires others to do the same. 

Achieving Happiness
===================

There are 3 ways to achieve happiness:

1. Work towards meaningful life goals, such as having a family or improving the world.
2. Accept everything as they are without judgement and expectations.
3. Meditate to clear the mind and happiness becomes the natural state.
