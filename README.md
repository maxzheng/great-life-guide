A Great Life Guide
==================

Life is great when you are able to fully understand, do, and enjoy everything that it has to offer. This provides
the steps to achieve that in a sustainable way, so everyone can be happy and do great things.

To be happy, just do what kids do best:

1. **Let go of everything** to reduce burden and make space for happiness, especially negativity as they will rot the
   core of your body and mind, such as hate, anger, jealousy, stress, addiction, sadness, fear, lingering thoughts,
   and tension. Relax, breath, and then just let them all go. You will feel lighter and ready to be happy. If it's hard
   to let go or you feel sad without knowing why, then just move on.

2. **Enjoy the present** for transient joy. Too often we get stuck thinking about the past or the future, and forget
   about the present, which is when happiness can be created. Don't think about what you don't have or could have, but
   appreciate and enjoy what you do have. Whatever you do, simply be present and enjoy it.

3. **Rest well** to rejuvenate and be ready for more fun. When you are tired, you are much more susceptible to accident,
   illness, and negativity, like anger and sadness. To sleep well, exercise to exhaust your energy, meditate to be calm,
   make sure you are comfortable, and do it consistently. Then you are energized and naturally happy.

3. **Nurture your drives with positivity** for lasting happiness. Identify the things that drive you, express them
   freely, and then encourage growth positively (e.g. praise, be thankful / loving / kind, celebrate wins, smile). If
   you don't feel driven, then manually push yourself to get started. Kids are naturally driven -- they explore the
   world with curiosity and excitement, let their emotions flow freely, indulges their desires (e.g. eat candy,
   watch TV), let their imaginations run wild, and finally, their love for family, friends, and things are pure,
   sincere, and overflowing. :heart:

To do great things:

1. **Activate your body, passion, and mind** to maximize potential. Start the day with nutritious food. Exercise
   regularly to strengthen your body. Do what you love and be your true self to let your passion flow abundantly as it
   amplifies results in multitudes. Always keep learning and thinking to push the boundary of your mind. Most of your
   capabilities are dormant until you push their limits, so try to push yourself a little bit each day to reach new
   heights. There's nothing that you can't do if you apply yourself. Finally and most importantly, don't forget to take
   breaks often and rest well to rejuvenate so everything can function at 100% at all times.

2. **Be mindful with acceptance** to maximize understanding and awareness of what's going on without judgement or
   expectations. Always be calm -- understand, learn, and then let go of anything that disturbs it (e.g. scan your body
   and mind often for any tension and loosen them). Stay focused while being aware of the surrounding (e.g. understand
   your emotions and enjoy them but don't let them take over). No matter what others say or do to you, retain the
   calmness and clarity to make decisions wisely.

3. **Concentrate on one thing at a time** to maximize efficiency. Prioritize things based on value to get the most out
   of limited time, and then focus on only one at a time to avoid overloading and context switching. If we do just that,
   everything actually gets done faster with higher quality.

4. **Do the right thing** to maximize performance. The fastest way to get things done is by doing the right thing as
   doing the wrong thing requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong thing
   for a short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins as it builds
   momentum from previous accomplishments. Always understand why you do something before how in order to do your best.
   Once you know what to do, then do it with everything that you got and don't let anything hold you back.
   Knowledge is only half of the story, action completes it, so don't be lazy; do as much as you can and persevere.

Easily remember the steps using the acronyms **LERN ABCD** from the first letter of each step. Being happy and doing
great things are distinct goals, but both are necessary to sustain and achieve your full potential over a life time.
Each step should be done in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results
are immediate and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take time to rest and reflect using
the steps. Mastery is achieved when all steps are done naturally for everything that you do. And voil√†, a great life! :smile:
