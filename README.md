To be the greatest you, follow these 5 simple steps consistently:

1. **One thing at a time.** There are many things going on in life, and so life seems complicated, but realistically,
   we can do or think about one thing at a time. If we do just that, life becomes simple, and things actually get
   done faster with higher quality.

2. **Be mindful with acceptance.** This lets you fully take in, understand, and enjoy what's currently happening
   (i.e. moments of life) without judgement or expectations. Meditate to train mindfulness by focusing on your breath or
   positive thoughts and emotions -- learn from and let go of negative ones and everything else. With everything that
   that you do, be focused while being aware of the surrounding. Then you are peaceful, and nothing from the outside
   can disturb you -- no matter what others say or do to you. Happiness starts from here.

3. **Energize your body, passion, and mind.** Those are the raw energies that enable you to do everything at peak
   performance. Exercise regularly to build up energy in your body. Do what you love, enjoy everything that
   you do, and be your true self to let your passion flow freely and wildly. Always keep learning and thinking to push
   the boundary of your mind. Finally don't forget to rest well to rejuvenate. Keep your heart pumping fast and live
   passionately! :heart:

4. **Aim at your target.** There must be a target (e.g. task, goal, mission) at any time as it provides the direction
   for what you want to do so you don't wander around aimlessly. There can be many targets, but aim at only one for a
   period of time to make good progress, then your life is fruitful. Set a goal for each day (e.g., today's goal is to
   relax and have fun). As there are many targets, you should set at least one life goal -- the big things that you want
   to do with your life. Prioritize the targets based on important values to get the highest return on your time.

5. **Do the right thing in the right way.** That is the fastest way to get everything you want as doing the wrong thing
   requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong things for a quick /
   short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins as it builds momentum
   from previous accomplishments. The right things to do are meaningful. It is equally important to do things in the
   right way with everything that you got and don't let anything hold you back, so you get the most out of time.

Easily remember the steps using the acronym **1 BEAD** from the first word/letter of each step. Each step must be done
successfully in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results are immediate
and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take a timeout to rest and reflect using the steps.
Mastery is achieved when all steps are followed consistently and naturally for everything that you do and are done
using **100%** of your energies with at least 1% for being mindful always. And voil√†, a great life! :smile:
