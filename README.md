A Great Life Guide
==================

Life is great when you are able to fully understand, do, and enjoy everything that it has to offer. This provides
the steps to achieve that in a sustainable way, so everyone can be happy and do great things.

To be happy, just do what kids do best:

1. **Let go of any negativity** to make space for happiness as they will rot the core of your body and mind, such hate,
   anger, jealousy, stress, addiction, sadness, fear, and anything that makes you feel unhappy. Relax your body, breath,
   and then just let them all go. You will feel lighter and ready to be happy.

2. **Enjoy the present** for transient joy. Too often we get stuck thinking about the past or the future, and forget
   about the present, which is when happiness can be created. Don't think about what you don't have or could have, but
   appreciate and enjoy what you do have. Like the old saying "you are what you eat", so you feel what you do, therefore
   do more things that make you happy: play with family and friends, eat delicious food, go shopping, build cool things,
   do nothing, etc. Whatever you do, simply be present and enjoy it.

3. **Nurture your drives using positive expressions** for lasting happiness. Identify the things that drive you,
   express them freely and liberally, and then encourage growth positively (e.g. praise, be thankful / loving / kind,
   celebrate wins, smile). Kids are always doing something because they are naturally driven and are not afraid to show
   it. It starts with their basic needs, like hunger. Then they explore the world meticulously with their senses.
   No matter the situation, they let their emotions flow freely. When calm, they start to satisfy their desires (e.g.
   eat candy, watch TV) and let their curiosity and imagination run wild. Finally, their love for family, friends, and
   things are pure, sincere, and overflowing. :heart:

To do great things:

1. **Activate your body, passion, and mind** to maximize potential. Start the day with nutritious food. Exercise
   regularly to strengthen your body. Do what you love and be your true self to let your passion flow abundantly as it
   amplifies results in multitudes. Always keep learning and thinking to push the boundary of your mind. Most of your
   capabilities are dormant until you push their limits, so try to push yourself a little bit each day to reach new
   heights. There's nothing that you can't do if you apply yourself. Finally and most importantly, don't forget to take
   breaks often and rest well to rejuvenate so everything can function at 100% at all times.

2. **Be mindful with acceptance** to maximize understanding and awareness of what's going on without judgement or
   expectations. Always be calm -- understand, learn, and then let go of anything that disturbs it (e.g. scan your body
   and mind often for any tension and loosen them). Stay focused while being aware of the surrounding (e.g. understand
   your emotions and enjoy them but don't let them take over). No matter what others say or do to you, retain the
   calmness and clarity to make decisions wisely.

3. **Concentrate on one thing at a time** to maximize efficiency. Prioritize things based on value to get the most out
   of limited time, and then focus on only one at a time to avoid overloading and context switching. If we do just that,
   everything actually gets done faster with higher quality.

4. **Do the right thing** to maximize performance. The fastest way to get things done is by doing the right thing as
   doing the wrong thing requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong thing
   for a short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins as it builds
   momentum from previous accomplishments. Always understand why you do something before how in order to do your best.
   Once you know what to do, then do it with everything that you got and don't let anything hold you back.
   Knowledge is only half of the story, action completes it, so don't be lazy; do as much as you can and persevere.

Easily remember the steps using the acronyms **LEN ABCD** from the first letter of each step. Being happy and doing
great things are two distinct goals and both are necessary to sustain and achieve your full potential over a life time.
Each step should be done in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results
are immediate and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take time to rest and reflect using
the steps. Mastery is achieved when all steps are done naturally for everything that you do. And voil√†, a great life! :smile:
