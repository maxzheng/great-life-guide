To be the greatest you, just follow these 5 simple steps consistently:

1. **One thing at a time.** There are so many things going on in life, and so life seems complicated and gets out of
   hand unless you put a limit on it. While there are so many things that need to be done or think about, at any moment,
   we really can do or think about one thing at a time. And if you do just that, life becomes simple again, and you get
   things done faster with higher quality. Doing many things at the same time, while it might seem to be faster, but
   it's actually not.

2. **Be mindful with acceptance.** This lets you fully take in, understand, and enjoy what's currently happening (i.e.
   moments of life) without judgement or expectations. You are completely relaxed, focused, and nothing from the outside
   disturbs you -- no matter what others say or do to you. Your life is perfect at this moment and there is nothing that
   you need or want.

3. **Energize your BEAM (body, emotion, attention, mind).** This is the raw energy that enables you to do everything
   at peak performance consistently. Exerise consistently to build up a strong body, focus on positive emotions to be
   happy, meditate to master your attention, use your brain often to push the boundary of your mind, and finally
   don't forget to rest well to rejuvenate.

4. **Aim at your goal.** This provides the direction for what you want to do so you don't wander around aimlessly going
   nowhere. There can be many goals, but aim at only one for a period of time to make good progress towards it.

5. **Do the right thing in the right way.** This is the fastest way to get what you want as doing the wrong thing
   requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong things for a quick /
   short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing will give you everything
   that you want in the fastest way, so there is no need for shortcuts. Once you know the right thing to do, it is
   important to do it in the right way as well.

An easy way to remember the steps is using the acronym **1 BEAD** from the first word/letter of each step. Another name
for the steps is master check (MC), so do master check or accept the consequences (MC or AC).
