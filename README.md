A Great Life Guide
==================

Life is great when you are able to fully understand, do, and enjoy everything that it has to offer. This lists
the steps to achieve that in a sustainable way, so everyone can be happy and do great things.

Before we start, we need to keep these goals in mind, our true north, so we don't get lost in the details:

1. **Truth**: There are too much misinformation out there, so it's hard to make the right decisions. As an intelligent
   being, we must seek the truth and use it to our advantage. Don't be afraid of it. There is no need to hide it by
   making up stories, etc. Never blindly believe what others say -- question everything to better understand. Our
   universe is vast and eagerly awaits us to explore it. Be excited for the opportunity!  Only truth can build trust,
   expand our wisdom, satisfy our curiosity, and build a solid foundation for everything else.

2. **Pleasure**: Too often we get stuck in the necessities of life, such as raising a family or earning money, that we
   forget to enjoy life. There is no need to choose one or the other, you can do both at the same time. You only live
   once, so experience everything that life has to offer. Don't be afraid to try everything once, as long as it is safe,
   because you never know what you like until you try -- sometimes you might need to try twice. Whatever you like to do,
   don't hold back and go for it! One of the greatest pleasure is love, so love everyone and everything as much as you can.

3. **Unity**: While a single person can do amazing things, but the greatest things can only be accomplished when we work
   together as one. That is every single living being -- not just humans, but animals, bacterials, plants, etc. More
   than half of your body cells are microbes! Existing concepts of countries, races, companies, individual families are
   superficial, archaic, and the division only causes harm. It's ok to have groups, but not superficial barriers
   that reduce collaboration, nor thinking other groups are different or inferior. We should help each other, work
   together, and share the fruits of labor, so everyone becomes better and benefits compound. When we don't work
   together, great things come to an abrupt end. Together, the possibilities are endless.

To be happy, just do what kids do best:

1. **Let go of everything** to reduce burden and make space for happiness. Negativity will rot the core of your body and
   mind, such as hate, anger, stress, addiction, sadness, fear. Relax, breath, and then just let them all go. You will
   feel lighter and ready to be happy. If it's hard to let go or you feel sad without knowing why, then just move on.

2. **Enjoy the present** for transient joy. Too often we get stuck thinking about the past or the future, and forget
   about the present, which is when happiness can be created. Don't think about what you don't have or could have, but
   appreciate and enjoy what you do have. Whatever you do, simply be present and enjoy it.

3. **Rest well** to rejuvenate and be ready for more fun. When you are tired, you are much more susceptible to accident,
   illness, and negativity. To sleep well, exercise to exhaust your energy, meditate to be calm, make sure you are
   comfortable, and do it consistently. Then you are energized and naturally happy.

3. **Nurture your drives with positivity** for lasting happiness. Identify the things that drive you, express them
   freely, and then encourage positively (e.g. praise, be thankful and loving, celebrate) and explicitly as
   assuming the obvious is often wrong and easily misinterpreted as otherwise. If you don't feel driven, then manually
   push yourself to get started. When you get negative feelings (e.g. tired, bored) while doing something good (e.g.
   exercise, reading), after letting them go, try to manifest positive feelings (e.g. excited, happy) by thinking about
   them or how what you are doing will help you in the future -- that will train your mind to enjoy doing good things.
   Another great way to train is by believing that you can do anything, which builds confidence and codes your mind to
   manifest them. Kids are naturally driven as they enjoy playing and their love for family, friends, and things are
   pure, sincere, and overflowing. :heart:

To do great things:

1. **Activate your body, passion, and mind** to maximize potential. Start the day with nutritious food. Exercise
   regularly to strengthen your body. Do what you love and be your true self to let your passion flow abundantly as it
   amplifies results in multitudes. Always keep learning and thinking to push the boundary of your mind. Most of your
   capabilities are dormant until you push their limits, so try to push yourself a little bit each day to reach new
   heights. There's nothing that you can't do if you apply yourself. Finally and most importantly, don't forget to take
   breaks often and rest well to rejuvenate so everything can function at 100% at all times.

2. **Be mindful with acceptance** to maximize understanding and awareness of what's going on without judgement or
   expectations. Always be calm -- understand, learn, and then let go of anything that disturbs it (e.g. scan your body
   and mind often for any tension and loosen them). Stay focused while being aware of the surrounding (e.g. understand
   your emotions and enjoy them but don't let them take over). No matter what others say or do to you, retain the
   calmness and clarity to make decisions wisely.

3. **Concentrate on one thing at a time** to maximize efficiency. Prioritize things based on value to get the most out
   of limited time, and then focus on only one at a time to avoid overloading and context switching. If we do just that,
   everything actually gets done faster with higher quality.

4. **Do the right thing** to maximize performance. The fastest way to get things done is by doing the right thing as
   doing the wrong thing requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong thing
   for a short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins as it builds
   momentum from previous accomplishments. Always understand why you do something before how in order to do your best.
   Once you know what to do, then do it with everything that you got and don't let anything hold you back.
   Knowledge is only half of the story, action completes it, so don't be lazy; do as much as you can and persevere.
   What is right for you might not be right for others as each person has different information, so it's important to
   respect other people's decisions and properly exchange information.

Easily remember the steps using the acronym **TPU LERN ABCD** from the first letter of each step. Being happy and doing
great things are distinct goals, but both are necessary to sustain and achieve your full potential over a life time.
Each step should be done in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results
are immediate and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take time to rest and reflect using
the steps. Mastery is achieved when all steps are done naturally at all times. And voil√†, a great life! :smile:
