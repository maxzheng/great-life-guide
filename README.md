A Great Life Guide
==================

Life is great when you are able to fully understand, do, and enjoy everything that it has to offer. This provides
the steps to achieve that in a sustainable way, so everyone can be happy and do great things.

To be happy, just do what kids do best:

1. **Let go of any negativity** as they will rot the core of your body and mind. All the hate, anger, jealousy, stress,
   depression, addiction, argument, yelling, and anything that makes you feel unhappy and unhealthy must be let go.
   Relax your body, breath, and then just let them all go. You will feel lighter and ready to be happy.

2. **Enjoy the present.** Too often we get stuck thinking about the past or the future, and forget about the present,
   which is where happiness can be found. Like the old saying "you are what you eat", so you feel what you do.
   If you want to be happy, well, do things that make you happy: play with friends, eat yummy food, go shopping,
   build cool things, do nothing, love your family and friends, etc. Whatever you do, simply be present and enjoy it.

3. **Driven by human nature.** Kids are always doing something interesting.
   It starts with their basic human needs, like hunger. Then they explore the physical world meticulously with their
   senses. No matter the situation, they let their emotions flow freely. Once they are settled, they start to satisfy
   their desires (e.g. eating candy, play with their toys) and let their curiosity and imagination run wild.
   Finally, their love for family, friends, and things are pure, sincere, and overflowing. :heart:

To do great things:

1. **Be mindful with acceptance** to fully understand and be aware of what's going on without judgement or expectations.
   Always be calm, and let go and learn from anything that disturbs it (e.g. consistently scan your body/mind for any
   tension and loosen them). Stay focused while being aware of the surrounding (e.g. track your emotions and
   understand/feel them but don't let them take over). No matter what others say or do to you, retain the calmness and
   clarity to make decisions objectively.

2. **Energize your body, passion, and mind** to increase your potential. Exercise regularly to build your body. Do what
   you love and be your true self to let your passion flow as it amplifies results in multitudes. Always keep
   learning and thinking to push the boundary of your mind. Finally don't forget to take breaks often and rest well to
   rejuvenate so everything can function at 100% at all times.

3. **Aim at one target at a time.** There must be a target (e.g. task, goal, mission) at any time as it provides the
   direction for what you want to do so you don't wander around aimlessly. Prioritize targets based on value to get
   the most out of limited time, and then focus on only one at a time to avoid overloading and context switching,
   therefore increasing efficiency. If we do just that, everything becomes simple and actually gets done faster with
   higher quality.

4. **Maximize your performance by doing the right thing in the right way.** That is the fastest way to get everything
   done as doing the wrong thing requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the
   wrong things for a short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins
   as it builds momentum from previous accomplishments. It is equally important to do things in the right way with
   everything that you got and don't let anything hold you back. Always understand why you do something before how in
   order to do your best. Knowledge is only half of the story, action completes it, so don't be lazy, but persevere and
   do as much as you can.

Easily remember the steps using the acronyms **LED BEAM** from the first letter of each step. With **LED**, you will be
happy and shine brightly in all directions. Focus it to do great things using **BEAM**. Each step should be done
successfully in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results are immediate
and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take a timeout to rest and reflect using the steps.
Mastery is achieved when all steps are done naturally for everything that you do. And voil√†, a great life! :smile:
