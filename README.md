A Great Life Guide
==================

Life is great when you are able to fully understand, do, and enjoy everything that it has to offer. This provides
the steps to achieve that in a sustainable way, so everyone can be happy and do great things.

To be happy, just do what kids do best:

1. **Let go of any negativity** as they will rot the core of your body and mind, such hate, anger, jealousy, stress,
   addiction, sadness, and anything that makes you feel unhappy. Relax your body, breath, and then just let them all go.
   You will feel lighter and ready to be happy.

2. **Enjoy the present.** Too often we get stuck thinking about the past or the future, and forget about the present,
   which is where happiness can be found. Like the old saying "you are what you eat", so you feel what you do, therefore
   do more things that make you happy: play with family and friends, eat delicious food, go shopping, build cool things,
   do nothing, etc. Whatever you do, simply be present and enjoy it.

3. **Display your natural drives.** Kids are always doing something because they are naturally driven and are
   not afraid to show it. It starts with their basic needs, like hunger. Then they explore the world meticulously with
   their senses. No matter the situation, they let their emotions flow freely. When calm, they start to satisfy their
   desires (e.g. eating candy, watch TV) and let their curiosity and imagination run wild.
   Finally, their love for family, friends, and things are pure, sincere, and overflowing. :heart:

To do great things:

1. **Be mindful with acceptance** to fully understand and be aware of what's going on without judgement or expectations.
   Always be calm, and let go and learn from anything that disturbs it (e.g. Scan your body and mind often for any
   tension and loosen them). Stay focused while being aware of the surrounding (e.g. track your emotions and understand
   and enjoy them but don't let them take over). No matter what others say or do to you, retain the calmness and clarity
   to make decisions wisely.

2. **Energize your body, passion, and mind** to increase your potential. Exercise regularly to build your body. Do what
   you love and be your true self to let your passion flow as it amplifies results in multitudes. Always keep
   learning and thinking to push the boundary of your mind. Finally don't forget to take breaks often and rest well to
   rejuvenate so everything can function at 100% at all times.

3. **Aim at one thing at a time** to improve efficiency. Prioritize things based on value to get the most out of
   limited time, and then focus on only one at a time to avoid overloading and context switching. If we do just that,
   everything actually gets done faster with higher quality.

4. **Maximize your performance in the right way.** The fastest way to get things done is by doing the right thing as
   doing the wrong thing requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong thing
   for a short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins as it builds
   momentum from previous accomplishments. Always understand why you do something before how in order to do your best.
   Once you know what to do, then do it with everything that you got and don't let anything hold you back.
   Knowledge is only half of the story, action completes it, so don't be lazy, but do as much as you can and persevere.

Easily remember the steps using the acronyms **LED BEAM** from the first letter of each step. With **LED**, you will be
happy and shine brightly in all directions. Focus it to do great things using **BEAM**. Each step should be done
in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results are immediate
and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take a timeout to rest and reflect using the steps.
Mastery is achieved when all steps are done naturally for everything that you do. And voil√†, a great life! :smile:
