Why & What
==========

Those are the most important questions that we should always be asking.

Why should you read this?
-------------------------

In short, because it is a single page that contains essential ideas that everyone should know to live a great life.
  
There are a lot of information on the Internet, in books, on TV, from family/friends, etc about how to have a happy and successful life, like good career and loving family, but all of them are scattered across different places. Access to all sources may not be readily available. There are also a lot of biases and opinions mixed in, so it's unclear what the truth is that delivers real value and results for having a great life. This does contain external links to get more details and attribution, but essential ideas will be here, so there is no need to look elsewhere to get your life started in the right direction.
  
Here are some of the things that you will learn:

* What is life and what can it like?
* Master's mindset that enables you.
* Define what you want out of life so you can iteratively get there.
* Simple steps to continuously improve yourself.
* Essential skills to improve the body and mind.

Why did I write this?
---------------------

I grew up with little parental guidance and learned everything from TV, school, other people, trial/error, etc, and always wished that I had someone that had a full life experience to guide me in the right direction to avoid many of the common mistakes that I had made. It took me 36 years to finally realize what life is all about, so I am hoping to save others some time by sharing.

As a parent now, I am glad that I can help my children grow, but I can also see other people going through the same things that I had without any guidance and making the similar mistakes, hence this could fill in some of that gap -- if they find it, :laughing: (hint: please share/like this!).

As a software engineer, I am always thinking about redundancy, and hence this would serve as a backup for my kids as well.

Why do we exist?
----------------

Why not. Now, let's do something great together!

What is life?
-------------

Life started about [4 billion years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) and has [evolved to the many species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) we have today. We interdepend on each other, even [microbes as they are a part of us](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/books/review/i-contain-multitudes-ed-yong.html). Therefore, humans are the same as other life forms except more intelligent.

As we grow, there are many things changing inside us, so here are some highlights and a bit of advice:

1. As a child, this is a great time to have fun as everything is new and exciting, so do savor the moments. Aside from having fun, it is also a great time to learn different skills that can accelerate latter stages of life. The brain just soaks up everything so easily, so why not.
2. As a teen, a lot of hormones are at work during this time to develop the body. Just let them do their magic, but don't let them take over decision making. Always use your mind. Learn and experience everything that life has to offer with some care -- as long as you keep a healthy body and mind, everything is a go. School dominates this stage. It's important to develop a love for learning. That is what separates those that will have a a successful life and those that don't.
3. As an adult, the final stage of life is also the beginning of the real life. The earlier stages are just prepration. This is the prime of your life where you can fully utilize your body and mind to make a difference in the world and really live the life that you want. At some point, hormones will influence you to find a mate and procreate, and you may become more loving and patient to care for your children so the human race continues on. Yay! Unfortunately, your body and mind will start to decline around age 40, so more effort is required to maintain health. 

What can life be like?
----------------------

It can be anything that you like -- that's the beauty of life, but it can be so much more when you push yourself to reach your full potential and everyone works together. 

Just to give an example, I see a future where no one has to do anything for basic needs as robots will provide them and everyone can do anything that they want. There will be no crime as there is no need to take when everyone will have everything -- access to everywhere, any information, any material possession. Some will party all day and night, but will get bored. Eventually, I believe everyone will want to work on creative things that expand the collective wisdom and enjoyment of life. 

But none of that will happen without an ubiquitous culture that enables them. A good culture starts with the right mindset.

Master's Mindset
================

Before anything else, you have to see the world clearly using an open mindset where you can do anything that you put your mind to -- i.e. a master's mindset. You are the master of your body and mind, and hence you can control them however you see fit to achieve your desires. To attain mastery, you must love to learn, practice, and experiment to push beyond artificial boundaries. As long as you are alive, you can improve yourself, inspire others to do the same, and together we can do great things, such as splitting the atom (done!), connecting the world at the speed of light (done!), space travel (almost), or building stars.

Let go of anything that holds you back, and go forth with passion to live life to the fullest! :smile:

Vision, Mission, and Goals
==========================

The first 20 years of life is mostly spent on learning and exploring. After that, it's important to know what you want out of life so you can iteratively attain them. It's possible to go through life just doing the minimal / taking the easy path, but that's just wasting the precious gift of your intelligence and you won't actually enjoy as much as someone that have meaningful goals. Until you figure them out, keep learning/exploring to keep your body and mind sharp as you will need them in tip-top shape when the time comes.

A vision paints a future world that you want yourself or your children to live in. This serves as a true north for everything that you do. E.g. world peace, end poverty, or everyone is happy. This should inspire you.

A mission describes how you want to achieve the vision. This can change over time as you learn, but should be the single most important thing that you are trying to do as long as you are alive. E.g. I want to continuously improve myself to reach my full potential and help others to do the same, so together we can do great things.

And finally, there can be many goals in your life, such as getting married, having kids, or have a great career.

In short, if you want to get somewhere, you have to know where you are going and how to get there.

Continuous Improvement
======================

To iteratively get closer to your vision, mission, and goals, follow these 5 simple steps to continously improve yourself:

1. **Set stage that enables you.** This places you in the master's mindset where you are enabled to do anything in the right setting and mood. E.g. Life is a game, so relax and have fun!

2. **Set intentions based on your vision, mission, and goals.** This provides the direction for what you want to do without expectation. E.g. If the goal is to cure cancer, then an intention could be learning about cell formation under different scenarios.

3. **Be mindful of the present with acceptance.** This allows you to fully take in, understand, and enjoy what's currently happening (i.e. moments of life). This should be the default state unless you need to concentrate on something else.

4. **Do the right thing.** This is the fastest way to get what you want as doing the wrong thing requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong things for a quick / short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing will give you everything that you want in the fastest way, so there is no need for shortcuts. 

5. **Be rock solid.** This is the safest way to get what you want as there are many challenges and bad actors that will block you so it's important to believe in yourself, stand firmly behind your ideas and beliefs, and never waver -- like a rock. 

There is a balance between the last two. Doing the right thing without being rock solid will result in a breakdown as everything will become too heavy and eventually crumble. Being rock solid without doing the right thing is obviously wrong and you probably won't get what you want.

A short name for the steps is Master Check (MC). I like to recall the acronym "MC" often to ensure I run through all the steps to continously improve myself to reach my full potential and get closer to my vision.

For kids, the first two steps are a bit harder to grasp, so set it for them. I.e. Tell them they can do anything they put their minds to and have fun while doing it.

Essential Skills
================

It's not enough to train the body or mind, but both are required to get optimal performance as they interdepend on each other. 

The saying "if you don't use it, you will loose it" applies to both body and mind. Due to cell aging as you get older, it becomes important to train more and consistently.

Training each skill is not easy and doesn't necessarily feel good, so **perseverance is required** and is what differentiates those that can master the skill and those that don't.

Attention
---------

All skills require paying attention in order to do them well, so this is one of the most important skills. 

Meditation is a good way to train attention. Other way is simply pay attention whenever you do something -- simply paying attention when eating, walking, talking, thinking, etc. When you feel tired, then do take a break and just let the mind rest.

Always pay attention to truly enjoy and appreciate every miniscule details of life, otherwise you are just letting life slip by.

Believe
-------

You have believe in your ideas in order to materialize them to reality. Be confident. Don't let other people's ideas limit you. As soon as you believe something isn't possible or in negative thoughts, then life becomes that.

If you believe the world is hard and coming to get you and other people are horrible, well that's what will happen. If you believe everyone is good and the world is full of possibilities, then that's what you will get as well. Of course, don't believe in some things blindly or you will get hurt. It's good to believe everyone can be good, but you can't simply believe everyone is currently good as that's false.

So positive and believe anything is possible.

Compassion
----------

It starts with empathy to truly understand what others are feeling and going through and ends with the desire to help them. Its value is it lets us connect with each other at the deepest level to form trust that unifies everyone as one instead of fighting each other.

To understand others, put yourself in their shoes and see things from their perspective while emulating their emotions in the process without being affected.

To help others, teach them as other ways may actually do harm in the long run. And careful not to spend too much time helping others that may significantly affect your own goals. Each person should be provided with all the necessities to be successful, however success must earned by each person with their own hands. When success is given, it's not sustainable.

Creativity
----------

Think about what you can do to make things better for you and everyone. [Creativity wins over intelligence](https://drmbloomfield.com/blog/2018/4/12/why-creativity-is-now-more-important-than-intelligence) in the long run.

Instead of doing the same boring things again and again, always spend some time to think of creative solutions that solve problems in less time and effort, which has a bonus of being fun too.

Curiosity
---------

Always be asking the hard questions -- why, what, how. Try to answer them yourself first before asking others, so you gain a deeper understanding and become smarter.

Emotional Intelligence
----------------------

It's easy for emotions to affect the health of your body (e.g. stress) and clarity of your mind, so it's important to [master emotional intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8fcqrNO7so) to better understand and enjoy them while retaining the ability to make sound decisions.

Start with training your attention using mindfulness [meditation] to become fully aware of your emotions, learn to accept and let them go, and finally form habits to permeate positive emotions with positive thoughts for yourself and others.

Execution
---------

Nothing happens until you do it. 

To do things well, focus on quality first before quantity. When doing things with quality, it builds a strong foundation for everything else that follows, which compounds over time to the point where quality work can be done faster than just focusing on quantity alone.

When focusing on quantity alone, while it might seem to be easy and a quick victory, it has a hidden cost of deteriorating the mind and skills over time. It's not worth it.

Exercise
--------

Exercise daily at least 30 minutes a day. Any form of exercise is fine, but yoga trains BESF (Balance, Endurance, Strenth, and Flexibility) and is highly recommended. Be sure to do some through the day as it [improves cognitive functions](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-you-think-better-after-walk-exercise/) by providing more blood (energy/oxygen) to the brain and stimulates hippocampus.

To improve strength and endurance, you have to push your muscle until it is exhausted. Once exhausted, then it rebuilds during rest to become stronger. Careful not to push too hard or it might cause damage -- feel soreness from exhaustion, not pain. Once exhausted, it provides a signal to the body that the muscle is not strong enough for what it needs to do. It's not enjoyable to be exhausted all the time, which reduces chance of repeating, so a suggestion is to do that when you feel up to it but at least once a week.

To make sure that you do exercise daily, use [direct motivations](#motivation). For days where you just don't feel like doing it, start small, like just do some stretching or walking. Once you get the ball rolling, it builds momentum and you may find yourself doing more, but it's ok to stop if you still don't feel up to it. Finding a workout partner is a great way to make it fun and keep each other accountable.

The good thing about exercise is that you get immediate feedback the next day with soreness. Keep going as it takes a week to get used to it and see the benefits. Aside from improving muscle, it will [reduce stress](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/exercise-and-stress/art-20044469) and [improve immumune system](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007165.htm) too. Yep, it's amazing.

Happiness
---------

There are a few ways to improve/train happiness -- a lasting inner peace and contentment regardless of what's going on so you can freely do everything that you want without emotional hindrance:

1. Be part of a community, such as being an good member of a family, company, or society in pursuit of common goals. 
2. Work towards meaningful goals, such as getting married, having kids, or improving the world.
3. Accept everything as they are without judgement and expectations.
4. Meditate to clear the mind and happiness becomes the natural state.

Happiness isn't the same as happy, which is a fleeting joyous emotion from experiences. Both are essential to have. A good analogy is a tree where the trunk represents happiness and the leaves represent happy moments. Leaves grow and fall often and its quality depends on nutrients from the trunk (happiness).

Intelligence
------------

Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to [become more intelligent](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/you-can-increase-your-intelligence-5-ways-to-maximize-your-cognitive-potential/) by using your brain as much as possible. A simple example is comparing the intelligence of a person that studies a lot vs one that studies a little.

Like exerise that improves the body, simply using your brain will improve your intelligence. The more that you use it in different ways, the more intelligent that you will become. Best way to use the brain is by mastering the other essential skills.

A great life only requires a certain minimal level of intelligence. A higher intelligence does make acquiring other skills easier and make better use of them, however it won't yield a great life without the other essential skills.

Leadership
----------

Be a [transcendent leader](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/become-transcendent-leader-reid-hoffman) that follows the mission, not other people, and inspires others to do the same. Lead with meaning, not money.

There are a couple of traits that makes a great leader, such as openness, compassion, passion, and wisdom. To be a great leader, you have to be *highly focused* and *build trust* amongst everyone to *execute well* to achieve a *common and great vision*. The greatness of all leaders is measured by their ability to *influence* and *inspire* others to make an *impact*. The best ways to inspire and influence others is having a great vision, walk the talk, and using [direct motivations](#motivation).

Learning
--------

Read daily to learn new things to keep the mind interested and active. The entire human knowledge is written in books or on the Internet, which took thousands of years from billions of people to create, so leverage them to save yourself the time and avoid the same mistakes.

The best way to learn is to practice and experiment. To improve learning, learn [how to improve mental performance](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/kwik-brain-with-jim-kwik/id1208024744) and [how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), such as:

1. Paying attention to concentrate on specific things to get things done and take breaks often to let the brain rest, organize the information, and connect to other information to come up with more ideas. Both concentration and rest are equally important to get optimal performance. 
2. Making it fun. The more that you enjoy doing something, the more likely that you will continue and remember.
3. To memorize lots of information, use memory techniques like [making vivid stories out of arbitrary words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_link_system) or map things to locations using the [loci method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci). Simply paying attention and repeated use are essential.
4. Attaining [flow, optimal experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), by doing things that are not too easy (boring), nor too hard (exhausting). Both leads to bad performance and slow learning. When you do things that match your skill exactly or slightly above, then you get optimal performance that is enjoyable as well.
5. Learn [speed reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading) to consume more information in less time. A good way to do that is by reading in one phrase (concept) at a time instead of one word.
6. Eat healthy and exercise. Optimal body enables the brain to perform at its peak.
7. To understand better and remember longer, study using the same amount of time spread over multiple intervals instead of all at once.

Love
----

Love is the most powerful emotion that drives passion. Love as many and as much as you can. It feels good and makes life more enjoyable for you and others. Careful to not mistake it with obsession, or let it cloud your judgements. True love requires compassion.

Meditation
----------

[Mindfulness meditation](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) is where you pay attention to nothing, your breath, or any single thing for a long period of time. Simply by doing that calms the mind and trains attention, which improves utilization of memory and cognitive processing by moving [mental energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/raquelbaldelomar/2017/01/31/manage-your-mental-energy-to-be-more-productive-at-work/) -- a limited and precious resource -- away from random thoughts to specific desired ones. This also helps with awareness of emotions and other states of the body and mind, which helps to keep them in check and to maximize their use for your benefits.

The [body scan meditation](https://www.mindful.org/beginners-body-scan-meditation/) is another good one where you go through your entire body from head to toe focusing on one area at a time mindfully to really feel and be with your body.

The bad thing about meditation is that it takes a long time to see the benefits. After about 3 months, then you will become more aware of your emotions, thoughts, and senses and therefore start to gain the ability to control them. The benefits are worth the wait. To speed up the process, try to be mindful for everything that you do throughout the day.

Motivation
----------

Be motivated by using [play, purpose, and potential (PPP)](https://hbr.org/2015/11/how-company-culture-shapes-employee-motivation) for everything that you do. 

* Play is where you enjoy what you do and is the most powerful motivator. Use your creativity to make any task enjoyable.
* Purpose is what you get after you do something. Always understand why you are doing something and its value.
* Potential is what you might be able to do in the future after you have done it.

Motivation can be negatively impacted by emotional/economic pressure and inertia.

Prioritization
--------------

There are so many things to do, so it's important to prioritize on the ones that provide the most value. You will be surprised how much more time that you have once you focus on the important things and let the unimportant ones simmer until they become more valuable or discarded.

It's important to do the most valuable, especially the hard ones, first in the beginning of the day as your [mental energy is limited](https://www.forbes.com/sites/raquelbaldelomar/2017/01/31/manage-your-mental-energy-to-be-more-productive-at-work/) and only resets with rest.

To find the most valuable thing to do, there are a few things to consider:

* The cost of doing it. Doing things with the highest value over cost ratio yields the most productive use of time and therefore greatest gain over shortest amount of time.
* Indirect/future benefits after it is done. This is true for foundational work, such as learning/meditation/exercise, which has many benefits across different areas and into latter stages of life.
* Opportunities to combine multiple things. Instead of just doing exercise or driving to work, simply add listening to the news/ebooks/music to get benefits of two with the same cost.

Rest
----

The most powerful skill is rest. Rest allows the body and mind to recover and rebuild to become stronger. Without rest, they won't grow as fast or strong and may burn out. Here are some suggestions: 

1. Train on weekdays, but rest on weekends.
2. Consistently sleep [about 8 hours a day](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times/page/0/1) with meditation before and afterward to comfort the mind and a warm/comfortable bed to comfort the body. Consistent sleep cycle, that is start time and duration, is key to optimal performance for all other skills, otherwise you will just be grumpy and slow.
3. Lastly, go out and have fun! :wink:

Relationships
=============

Alone we can do some things. Together we can do everything. For all relationships, focus on quality and not quantity.

Family
------
  
Friends may come and go, but family will always be there \[as long as you don't misuse\].

Friend
------

Life is more fun with friends.

Colleague
---------

Together we can do great things. More brains = more ideas = better solutions.

Spouse
------

Finding someone that you want to create a family with and spend the rest of your life could be hard at first, but as with anything else, practice makes it easy. Start with dating different people to find someone with common interests and values. There may be a few heartbreaks along the way, but just learn from the failures and move on to the next. This is also a very exciting time, so enjoy the moments. 

Once you do find someone, be compassionate as no one is perfect. With compassion, trust and love can form, and those will build a lasting marriage. The strongest bond is built on play, so try to enjoy each other's company.

Offspring
---------

It's amazing to create another human being with similar traits to you and your spouse. Enjoy every moment and teach them well to become successful adults. Kids just want to have fun, so join them.

Be sure to take good care of their health, such as brushing their teeth twice daily and floss nightly. They need to eat lots of healthy food and sleep/nap appropriately ([12+ hours per day](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times/page/0/1)).
