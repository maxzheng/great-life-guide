A Great Life Guide
==================

Life is great when you are able to fully understand, do, and enjoy everything that it has to offer. This provides
the steps to achieve that in a sustainable way, so everyone can be happy and do great things.

To be happy, just do what kids do best:

1. **Let go of any negativity** as they will rot the core of your body and mind. All the hate, anger, jealousy, stress,
   physical/mental pain, addiction, muscle tension, anything that makes you feel unhappy and unhealthy must be let go.
   Relax your body, breath, and then just let them all go. You will feel lighter and ready to be happy.

2. **Enjoy the present.** Too often we get stuck thinking about the past or the future, and forget about the present,
   which is where happiness can be found. As the old saying goes, you are what you eat, and so you are what you do.
   If you want to be happy, well, do things that make you happy: play and have fun, eat yummy food, go shopping,
   watch your favorite shows, exercise your body and mind, build new things, complete cool projects at work, do nothing,
   love your family and friends, etc. Whatever you do, simply be present and enjoy it.

To do great things:

1. **One thing at a time.** There are many things going on in life, and so life seems complicated, but realistically,
   we can do or think about one thing at a time. If we do just that, life becomes simple, and things actually get
   done faster with higher quality.

2. **Be mindful with acceptance** to fully take in, understand, and enjoy the present without judgement or expectations.
   Meditate to train mindfulness by focusing on your breath or positive thoughts and emotions -- learn from and let go
   of negative ones. With everything that that you do, be focused while being aware of the surrounding.
   Then you are peaceful, and nothing from the outside can disturb you -- no matter what others say or do to you.

3. **Energize your body, passion, and mind** to perform at peak performance. Exercise regularly to build your body.
   Do what you love, enjoy everything that you do, and be your true self to let your passion flow freely and wildly.
   Always keep learning and thinking to push the boundary of your mind. Finally don't forget to rest well to rejuvenate.
   Love everything and everyone as much as you can as it amplifies results in multitudes and just feels great. :heart:

4. **Aim at your target.** There must be a target (e.g. task, goal, mission) at any time as it provides the direction
   for what you want to do so you don't wander around aimlessly. There can be many targets, but focus at only one for a
   period of time to make good progress. Prioritize the targets based on value -- amount of benefit over time.

5. **Do the right thing in the right way.** That is the fastest way to get everything you want as doing the wrong thing
   requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong things for a quick /
   short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins as it builds momentum
   from previous accomplishments. It is equally important to do things in the right way with everything that you got and
   don't let anything hold you back. Always understand why you do something before how in order to do the best.
   Knowledge is only half of the story; action completes it. Don't procrastinate / be lazy, but persevere and do as much
   as you can.

Easily remember the steps using the acronyms **LE 1 BEAD** from the first word/letter of each step. Each step
must be done successfully in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results
are immediate and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take a timeout to rest and reflect
using the steps. Mastery is achieved when all steps are followed consistently and naturally for everything that you do
and are done at **100%**. And voil√†, a great life! :smile:
