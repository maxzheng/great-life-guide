A Great Life Guide
==================

This will help you to have a great life that is simple, happy, passionate, fruitful, and meaningful.

To be the greatest you, follow these 5 simple steps consistently:

1. **One thing at a time.** There are so many things going on in life, and so life seems complicated and gets out of
   hand unless you put a limit on it. At any moment, we really can do or think about one thing at a time. If you do
   just that, life becomes simple, and you get things done faster with higher quality.

2. **Be mindful with acceptance.** This lets you fully take in, understand, and enjoy what's currently happening
   (i.e. moments of life) without judgement or expectations. Meditate by focusing on your breath or positive thoughts
   and emotions, and let go of negative ones and everything else. Then you are completely relaxed, focused, happy, and
   nothing from the outside can disturb you -- no matter what others say or do to you. Your life is perfect at this moment.

3. **Energize your body, passion, and mind.** This is the raw energy that enables you to do everything
   at peak performance consistently. Exercise regularly to build up energy in your body, do what you love and be your
   true self to let your passion flow freely and wildly, always keep learning and thinking to push the boundary
   of your mind, and finally don't forget to rest well to rejuvenate. Keep your heart pumping fast and live passionately!

4. **Aim for your goal.** This provides the direction for what you want to do so you don't wander around aimlessly going
   nowhere. There can be many goals, but aim at only one for a period of time to make good progress, then your life is
   fruitful. Set a goal for each day (e.g. For today, my goal is to relax and have fun!). As there are many goals, to
   make sure you get everything you want out of life, you should set at least one life goal -- the big things that you
   want to do with your life.

5. **Do the right thing in the right way.** This is the fastest way to get what you want as doing the wrong thing
   requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong things for a quick /
   short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins as it builds momentum
   from previous accomplishments, so there is no need for shortcuts. Once you know the right thing to do, it is
   equally important to do it in the right way as well. The right things to do are meaningful.

An easy way to remember the steps is using the acronym **1 BEAD** from the first word/letter of each step. Each step
must be done successfully in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results
are immediate and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take a timeout to rest and reflect
using the steps. Mastery is achieved when all steps are followed consistently and naturally for everything that you do.
And voil√†, a great life! :smile:
