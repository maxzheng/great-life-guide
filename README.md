A Great Life Guide
==================

> **Warning**: This guide will make you [happy and productive every day](story.md) for the rest of your life!

Life is great when you are able to fully understand, do, and enjoy everything that it has to offer. This lists
the steps to achieve that in a meaningful and sustainable way, so everyone can be happy and productive.

Power
-----

Before we can do anything, we must have power -- the energy that fuels everything we do. To attain unlimited power,
start each day and action powerfully.

1. **Breathe deeply** to fully oxygenate your cells and remove toxins. Most of the time, we breathe
   too shallow due to the changing nature of our activities. Your body and brain won't function optimally when there
   aren't enough oxygen. Try to do it at least a few times a day for a few minutes, or whenever you need an extra boost.

2. **Eat intelligently** to efficiently get nutrients from food. With today's fast paced society, we
   often eat quickly and haphazardly, which causes many digestion-related health issues, such as indigestion. The
   quality of your fuel translates to the quality of your power. Eat natural, organic, less processed, and balanced food
   as much as possible as they contain more nutrients with less toxins. Apply food combining techniques to improve
   digestion whenever possible.

3. **Empower yourself with positive emotions, motions, and states.** Negative emotions disempower you as they drain
   your power or control. When you feel a negative emotion, immediately replace it with a positive one by generating the
   feeling so you are always empowered to make changes for the better in any situation. When you move, do so positively
   -- powerful, intentional, and in good form. Complete your movements in positive physical states (good posture, happy
   facial expression, etc.). Your motions and states can change how you feel, and vice versa, as emotion is energy in
   motion. Negative thoughts can drain your mental energy, so maintain a positive mental state at all times by replacing
   negative thoughts with positive ones that empowers you. Focus on what you can do and how they can make things better.

4. **Sleep well** to rejuvenate your energy and more. When you don't sleep well, you are much
   more susceptible to accidents, illnesses, and negativities (e.g. sadness, anger, hate). To sleep well, exercise to
   exhaust your body during the day, meditate before/after bed to calm your mind and emotion, comfort yourself in a nice
   bed, and consistently do it at the same time to create a rhythm -- that's Emc² from the first letters. Don't get out
   of bed until you finish sleeping!


Happiness
---------

To maximize your happiness, just do what kids do best:

1. **Let go of everything** to reduce burden and make space for happiness. Negativity will rot the core of your body and
   mind and affect everything you do, so let it go. External things (e.g. work projects, family issues) will prevent you
   from being fully happy, so let them go. Relax, breath, and then just let them all go. You will feel lighter and ready
   to be happy. It doesn't mean that you don't care or ignore everything, but simply not letting them affect you
   negatively to enable you to make changes wisely and move forward. If it's hard to let go or you feel sad without
   knowing why, then go back to previous step or move onto next.

2. **Overflow with positivity** to boost your happiness. Identify the things that makes you happy you, do and express
   them openly, and then encourage positively (e.g. praise, be thankful and loving, celebrate) and explicitly as
   assuming the obvious is often wrong and easily misinterpreted as otherwise. Be thankful for what you have
   each day. Give to others whenever possible, especially wisdom and compassion. Tell your love ones that you
   love them as much as possible. Celebrate every win -- big or small! Focus on the positive side, the
   solutions, and the actions that you can take to become happier rather than the problem. Kids' love for their family,
   friends, and things are pure, sincere, and overflowing. :heart:

3. **Vary your perception** for lasting happiness. What makes you happy is based on how and what you perceive, such as
   your perceived progress, state, meaning, and bond. When there is gap between what you have vs expect, then
   unhappiness grows. Change how you perceive by changing the meaning of what you perceive. If you create a belief that
   you are happy with what you have no matter what, then you are. Change your belief system to enable you to be happy
   every day, and then you will. If you don't want to change how you perceive, then you need to change what you perceive
   -- ensure it is 100% under your control, otherwise you are setting yourself up for a roller coaster ride that you
   might not enjoy. Think happy and therefore you are.

4. **Enjoy the present** to live your life. Too often we get stuck thinking about the past or the future, and forget
   about the present, which is when life happens and happiness can be created. Don't think about what you don't have or
   could have, but appreciate and enjoy what you do have. Whatever you do, simply be present and enjoy it. Kids are
   naturally gifted in this and it is why they are so happy all the time.

Productivity
------------

To maximize your productivity:

1. **Activate your body, passion, and mind** to maximize potential. Start the day with nutritious food. Exercise
   regularly to strengthen your body. Do what you love and be your true self to let your passion flow abundantly as it
   amplifies results in multitudes. Always keep learning and thinking to push the boundary of your mind. There's
   enormous synergy between the potentials of your body, passion, and mind. Most of your capabilities are dormant until
   you push their limits, so try to push yourself a little bit each day to reach new heights. There's nothing that you
   can't do if you believe in and apply yourself. Finally, don't forget to take breaks whenever you are not at an
   optimal state and rest well to rejuvenate so everything can function at 100% at all times.

2. **Be mindful with acceptance** to maximize understanding and awareness of what's going on without judgement or
   expectations. Always be calm -- understand, learn, and then let go of anything that disturbs it (e.g. scan your body
   and mind often for any tension and loosen them). Stay focused while being aware of the surrounding (e.g. understand
   your emotions and enjoy them but don't let them take over). No matter what others say or do to you, retain the
   calmness and clarity to make decisions wisely.

3. **Concentrate on one thing at a time** to maximize efficiency. Prioritize things based on value to get the most out
   of limited time, and then focus on only one at a time to avoid overloading and context switching. If we do just that,
   everything actually gets done faster with higher quality.

4. **Do the right thing in the right way** to maximize performance. The fastest way to get things done is by doing the
   right thing as
   doing the wrong thing requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong thing
   for a short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins as it builds
   momentum from previous accomplishments. Always understand why you do something before how in order to do your best.
   Once you know what to do, then do it with everything that you got and don't let anything hold you back.
   Knowledge is only half of the story, action completes it, so don't be lazy; do as much as you can and persevere.
   What is right for you might not be right for others as each person has different information, so it's important to
   respect other people's decisions and properly exchange information to reach alignment. When you don't get the results
   you expect, then iterate or pivot -- learn from it and find a better way. The shortest path to success is learning
   from and leveraging others.

Values
------

To build lasting relationships and ensure the prosperity of humanity, we must embed these values in our hearts for
everything that we do:

1. **Pleasure**: Too often we get stuck in the dramas or necessities of life that we forget to enjoy it.
   There is no need to choose one or the other, you can do both at the same time. You only live once, so experience
   everything that life has to offer. Don't be afraid to try everything once, as long as it is safe, because you never
   know what you will like until you try -- sometimes you might need to try twice. Whatever you like to do, don't hold
   back and go for it! One of the greatest pleasure is love, so **love everyone and everything as much as you can** --
   that is the secret to lasting happiness and productivity.

2. **Unity**: If we simply do what we believe is right at the expense of the our relationships, then we have won the
   battle but have lost the war. Both are important and there are ways to solve the problems so that both can be
   satisfied, but the relationship comes first if you must choose one -- because even if we accomplish the most amazing
   feats, they are pointless if there is no one for us to share with.
   While a single person can do amazing things, the greatest things can only be accomplished when we work
   together as one. That is every single living being, not just humans, as we interdepend (e.g. we need the oxygen from
   trees and more than half of your body cells are microbes!). Divisions of countries and races are superficial and only
   causes harm. It's ok to have groups, but not superficial barriers that hinder collaboration, nor thinking other
   groups are different or inferior. We should help each other, work together, and share the fruits of labor, so
   everyone becomes better and benefits compound. When we don't work together, great things come to an abrupt end.
   Together, the possibilities are endless.

3. **Curiosity**: The old saying "curiosity kills the cat" is better rephrased as "curiosity transforms the cat into a
   lion." Be curious about people, places, and things, so that we are open to fully understand and improve.
   Without it, we would stay the same and there would be no improvements, therefore prosperity would stagnant. To
   maximize prosperity, we must always be curious about everything -- in the past, present, and future.

4. **Truth**: There are too much misinformation out there, so it's hard to make the right decisions. As an intelligent
   being, we must seek the truth and use it to our advantage. Don't be afraid of it. There is no need to hide it by
   making up stories, etc. Never blindly believe what others say -- question everything to better understand. Our
   universe is vast and eagerly awaits us to explore. Be excited for the opportunity! Only truth can build trust,
   expand our wisdom, satisfy our curiosity, and build a solid foundation for everything else.




Personal Mission and Dreams
---------------------------

To ensure that you don't get lost in the details and to gain more meaning in your life, you should have a personal
mission, which is something that you are passionate about and want to do in your lifetime, gets you out of bed early
every morning, you would gladly do for free, and is very *personal* to you. It's exciting to figure out and work
towards your dreams too. Your personal mission and dreams will provide you with a direction to focus your energy and
become more fulfilled.

My personal mission is to [enable everyone to be happy and productive](story.md) with a dream of human prosperity.

Putting It All Together
-----------------------

Being happy and productive sometimes diverge, but both are necessary to sustain and achieve your full potential
over a life time. Metaphorically, think of happiness as light from the sun that disperses in all
directions from a power core, while productivity is focusing all that light into a single point
with high intensity to complete your goals. With both, like the sun, you are self-sustaining and super
powerful, therefore you can accomplish anything you set your mind to and absolutely nothing can stop you.

Easily remember the steps using the acronym **BEES LOVE ABCD** from the first letter of each step. And **PUCT** for the
values pact.
Each step should be done in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results
are immediate and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take time to rest and reflect using
the steps. Mastery is achieved when all steps are done naturally at all times. And voilà, a great life! :smile:
