A Great Life Guide
==================

> **Warning**: This guide will make you [powerful, happy, productive, and prosperous every day](story.md) for the rest of your life!

Life is great when you can fully understand, do, and enjoy everything that it has to offer. This lists
the steps to achieve that in a meaningful and sustainable way, so everyone can be powerful, happy, productive, and
prosperous.

Power
-----

Before we can do anything, we must have power -- the energy that fuels everything we do. To attain unlimited power,
start each day and action powerfully.

1. **Breathe deeply** to fully oxygenate your cells and remove toxins. Most of the time, we breathe
   too shallow due to the changing nature of our activities. Your body and brain won't function optimally when there
   isn't enough oxygen. Try to do it at least a few times a day for a few minutes, or whenever you need an extra boost.

2. **Eat intelligently** to efficiently get nutrients from food. In today's fast-paced society, we
   often eat quickly and haphazardly, which causes many digestion-related health issues, such as indigestion. The
   quality of your fuel translates to the quality of your power. Eat natural, organic, less processed, and balanced food
   as much as possible as they contain more nutrients with fewer toxins. Apply food combining techniques to improve
   digestion whenever possible.

3. **Empower yourself with positive emotions, motions, and states.** Negative emotions disempower you as they drain
   your power or control. When you feel a negative emotion, immediately replace it with a positive one by generating the
   feeling so you are always empowered to make changes for the better in any situation. When you move, do so positively
   -- powerful, intentional, and in good form. Complete your movements in positive physical states (good posture, happy
   facial expression, etc.). Your motions and states can change how you feel, and vice versa, as emotion is energy in
   motion. Negative thoughts can drain your mental energy, so maintain a positive mental state at all times by replacing
   negative thoughts with positive ones that empower you. Fear can easily inhibit your thinking brain without your
   knowledge and drastically reduce your energy, so replace that with calmness or excitement. Focus on what you can do
   and how they can make things better.

4. **Sleep well** to rejuvenate your energy and more. When you don't sleep well, you are much
   more susceptible to accidents, illnesses, and negativities (e.g. sadness, anger, hate). To sleep well, exercise to
   exhaust your body during the day, meditate before/after bed to calm your mind and emotion, comfort yourself in a nice
   bed, and consistently do it at the same time to create a rhythm -- that's Emc² from the first letters. Don't get out
   of bed until you finish sleeping!


Happiness
---------

To maximize your happiness, just do what kids do best:

1. **Let go of everything** to reduce the burden and make space for happiness. Negativity will rot the core of your body
   and mind and affect everything you do, so let it go. External things (e.g. work projects, family issues) will prevent
   you from being fully happy, so let them go. Relax, breathe, and then just let them all go. You will feel lighter and
   ready to be happy. It doesn't mean that you don't care or ignore everything, but simply not letting them affect you
   negatively enables you to make changes wisely and move forward. If it's hard to let go or you feel sad without
   knowing why, then go back to the previous step or move onto the next.

2. **Overflow with positivity** to boost your happiness. Identify the things that make you happy, do and express
   them openly, and then encourage positively (e.g. praise, be thankful and loving, celebrate) and explicitly as
   assuming the obvious is often wrong and easily misinterpreted as otherwise. Be thankful for what you have
   each day. Give to others whenever possible, especially wisdom and compassion. Tell your loved ones that you
   love them as much as possible. Celebrate every win -- big or small! Focus on the positive side, the
   solutions, and the actions that you can take to become happier rather than the problem. Kids' love for their family,
   friends, and things is pure, sincere, and overflowing. :heart:

3. **Vary your perception** for lasting happiness. What makes you happy is based on how and what you perceive, such as
   your perceived progress, state, meaning, and bond. When there is a gap between what you have vs expect, then
   unhappiness grows. Change how you perceive by changing the meaning of what you perceive. If you create a belief that
   you are happy with what you have no matter what, then you are. Change your belief system to enable you to be happy
   every day, and then you will. If you don't want to change how you perceive, then you need to change what you perceive
   -- ensure it is 100% under your control, otherwise you are setting yourself up for a roller coaster ride that you
   might not enjoy. Think happy and therefore you are.

4. **Enjoy the present** to live your life. Too often we get stuck thinking about the past or the future and forget
   about the present, which is when life happens and happiness can be created. Don't think about what you don't have or
   could have, but appreciate and enjoy what you do have. Whatever you do, simply be present and enjoy it. Kids are
   naturally gifted in this and it is why they are so happy all the time.

Productivity
------------

To maximize your productivity:

1. **Activate your body, passion, and mind** to maximize potential. Start the day with nutritious food. Exercise
   regularly to strengthen your body. Do what you love and be your true self to let your passion flow abundantly as it
   amplifies results in multitudes. Always keep learning and thinking to push the boundary of your mind. There's
   an enormous synergy between the potentials of your body, passion, and mind. Most of your capabilities are dormant
   until you push their limits, so try to push yourself a little bit each day to reach new heights. There's nothing that
   you can't do if you believe in and apply yourself. Finally, don't forget to take breaks whenever you are not in an
   optimal state and rest well to rejuvenate so everything can function at 100% at all times.

2. **Be mindful with acceptance** to maximize understanding and awareness of what's going on without judgment or
   expectations. Always be calm -- understand, learn, and then let go of anything that disturbs it (e.g. scan your body
   and mind often for any tension and loosen them). Stay focused while being aware of the surrounding (e.g. understand
   your emotions and enjoy them but don't let them take over). No matter what others say or do to you, retain the
   calmness and clarity to make decisions wisely.

3. **Concentrate on one thing at a time** to maximize efficiency. Prioritize things based on value to get the most out
   of limited time, and then focus on only one at a time to avoid overloading and context switching. If we do just that,
   everything actually gets done faster with higher quality.

4. **Do the right thing in the right way** to maximize performance. The fastest way to get things done is by doing the
   right thing as
   doing the wrong thing requires redo and some things can not be undone. Sometimes it's tempting to do the wrong thing
   for a short-term gain, but there are always consequences. In the long run, doing the right thing wins as it builds
   momentum from previous accomplishments. Always understand why you do something before how in order to do your best.
   Once you know what to do, then do it with everything that you got and don't let anything hold you back.
   Knowledge is only half of the story, action completes it, so don't be lazy; do as much as you can and persevere.
   What is right for you might not be right for others as each person has different information, so it's important to
   respect other people's decisions and properly exchange information to reach alignment. When you don't get the results
   you expect, then iterate or pivot -- learn from it and find a better way. Embrace failure as it is one of the best
   ways to learn and the doorstep to success. The shortest path to success is learning from and leveraging others.

Prosperity
----------

To maximize prosperity:

1. **Begin with big and meaningful dreams.** To ensure that you don't get lost in the details and to gain more meaning
   in your life, you should have big dreams and a personal mission, which is something that you are passionate about
   and want to do in your lifetime, gets you out of bed early every morning, you would gladly do for free, and is very
   *personal* to you. It's exciting to figure out and work towards your dreams. Your personal mission and dreams will
   provide you with a direction to focus your energy and become more fulfilled. The more people that will be helped
   translate to more meaning and fulfillment. Dreams are supposed to be inspiring, so don't be afraid to dream big! Then
   do whatever it takes to ensure your reality allows you to make good progress towards your dreams. Once you have
   realized your dream, it's time to dream bigger!

2. **Embed good values in your heart** to ensure you do what's most important to you. At the minimum, start with these
   values to build long-lasting relationships: pleasure, unity, curiosity, and truth. Write down your values with
   priority and ensure all your dreams and actions align with them. The congruence will give you more power and the lack
   of it will cause internal conflict.

3. **Start with intentions and end with reflection.** Many things can happen in a day, so you won't
   know what you will get at the end of the day unless your intentions are set. Once you have set your intentions for
   the day, then your energy will naturally be focused on achieving them. Use intentions that work for you, but here
   is a generic one -- say it with lots of feeling for each word: I am going to be powerful, happy, productive, and
   prosperous today! At the end of the day, take some time to reflect and appreciate what you have learned and
   accomplished today so you can better retain what you have done to make tomorrow even better. Do the same for each
   action you take (e.g. meeting).

4. **Take massive actions.** At the end of the day, nothing happens without action. And big dreams require massive
   actions. Prioritize what you need to work on each day and get as many of them done as possible. The more that you do,
   the closer you are to your dreams and prosperity. Don't be afraid to take the wrong actions as it will happen -- just
   learn from it to minimize future recurrence. Give each action more meaning by remembering how it helps to achieve
   your dream. Enjoy and appreciate each action completed. And never ever stop!!

Values
------

To build lasting relationships and ensure the prosperity of humanity, we must embed these values in our hearts for
everything that we do:

1. **Pleasure**: Too often we get stuck in the dramas or necessities of life that we forget to enjoy it.
   There is no need to choose one or the other, you can do both at the same time. You only live once, so experience
   everything that life has to offer. Don't be afraid to try everything once, as long as it is safe, because you never
   know what you will like until you try -- sometimes you might need to try twice. Whatever you like to do, don't hold
   back and go for it! One of the greatest pleasures is love, so **love everyone and everything as much as you can** --
   that is the secret to lasting happiness and productivity.

2. **Unity**: If we simply do what we believe is right at the expense of our relationships, then we have won the
   battle but have lost the war. Both are important and there are ways to solve the problems so that both can be
   satisfied, but the relationship comes first if you must choose one -- because even if we accomplish the most amazing
   feats, they are pointless if there is no one for us to share with.
   While a single person can do amazing things, the greatest things can only be accomplished when we work
   together as one. That is every single living being, not just humans, as we interdepend (e.g. we need the oxygen from
   trees and more than half of your body cells are microbes!). Divisions of countries and races are superficial and only
   cause harm. It's ok to have groups, but not superficial barriers that hinder collaboration, nor thinking other
   groups are different or inferior. We should help each other, work together, and share the fruits of labor, so
   everyone becomes better and benefits compound. When we don't work together, great things come to an abrupt end.
   Together, the possibilities are endless.

3. **Curiosity**: The old saying "curiosity killed the cat" is better rephrased as "curiosity transformed the cat into a
   lion." Be curious about people, places, and things, so that we are open to fully understand and improve.
   Without it, we would stay the same and there would be no improvements, therefore prosperity would stagnant. To
   maximize prosperity, we must always be curious about everything -- in the past, present, and future.

4. **Truth**: There is too much misinformation out there, so it's hard to make the right decisions. As intelligent
   beings, we must seek the truth and use it to our advantage. Don't be afraid of it. There is no need to hide it by
   making up stories, etc. Never blindly believe what others say -- question everything to better understand. Our
   universe is vast and eagerly awaits us to explore. Be excited for the opportunity! Only truth can build trust,
   expand our wisdom, satisfy our curiosity, and build a solid foundation for everything else.

Mastery
-------

To gain mastery in life, there are a few areas that you need to have absolute understanding and command of:

1. **Life**: There are many theories about the origin of life, however that we began is interesting but keep in mind
   that they are theories and the truth is they are of no consequence in how we live it. Some theories leverage fear,
   safety, or purpose to turn them into truths. In reality, we don't need any of that. It's ok to begin without purpose
   so that you can define your own -- that's actually empowering even if it might not feel that way
   initially. It's ok to die when our time is up, but you are definitely welcome to try to change that. Understand the
   truth that we are stardust and the materials that we are made of never actually die but changes to
   different forms in a neverending cycle of life and death. However, that's only where we begin, how it ends is up to
   you -- completely in your own hands and no one else's. Appreciate the fact that you are conscious, act consciously to
   realize your dreams without fear or limits, and do good to expand the prosperity of humanity -- that's pretty
   meaningful. There can be many struggles and sufferings in life, but they are nothing more than obstacles in an
   obstacle course of life that you can appreciate as they help you become stronger and pave the way to define your
   unique identity.

2. **Identity**: Who are you? Why do you do what you do? Most people don't think too much about that until they have a
   midlife crisis or other traumatic events. Without knowing who you are, what you want out of life, and what everything
   means to you, it will be hard for you to achieve the outcome that you want as you are likely doing others' biddings.
   Take some time for yourself to think about those things and explicitly define your identity, beliefs, values,
   purpose, meaning, personal mission, and dreams. What society or others expect isn't necessarily something that you
   need to follow. That's where it starts, how it ends is totally up to you so you can achieve the outcome that you
   want for *your* life. If you have a hard time defining your identity, then it means you haven't experienced enough
   pains and pleasures of life -- go out and do more. In order to create your unique identity, you may need to break
   down your existing primitive and societal identity, which can lead to suffering, such as depression -- understand and
   appreciate that it is a part of the life journey. Becoming your authentic self is liberating, empowering, and
   necessary to realize your full potential. Your unique identity will guide the fine-tuning of your control.

3. **Control**: What separates us from animals is our ability to have absolute and conscious control of ourselves
   instead of relying on instincts alone. That ability allowed humanity to achieve much of its greatness. The lack of
   that ability left many atrocities in history and likely more to come. Most people see emotions, thoughts, actions,
   and events are out of their control and are all tied together in a big messy world of life. That's far from the
   truth. Each of those things is really distinct but your brain naturally ties them together as that's how it has
   evolved to work. Just because it is how it works out of the box, it doesn't mean it has to be that way. To gain
   absolute control, it's critical to separate them. For example, you change yourself to feel excited or sad right
   now, which has nothing to do with any thoughts, actions, or events. The sadness associated with
   failure can be changed to appreciation at will regardless of the thought that failure does help you grow. Consciously
   change your emotions, thoughts, actions, and events and train your brain with associations that support you instead
   of destroying. You can decide to feel depressed, happy, or not at any moment or for any event -- it's really a
   choice. You can decide to think negatively, positively, or nothing at all about anything. You can decide to take any
   action at any time or not. They can be tied together or isolated. All of them are choices and skills that you can
   master independently so that they can be leveraged more effectively together. Absolute and conscious control will
   help you take your skills to new heights.

4. **Skills**: All the steps in this guide are skills. Power steps improve your ability to gain unlimited energy.
   Happiness steps improve your ability to be happy every day. Productivity steps improve your ability to be productive.
   Prosperity steps improve your ability to be prosperous. Everything that you do is a skill, such as how you feel,
   think, and act. That's wonderful as it means everything can be improved with effort and the right approach. Natural
   talent is where you start, but where it ends is completely up to you. Skills can be pushed to world-class levels
   using deliberate practice with passion and coaching. Identify the smallest unit of improvement, figure out the best
   approach, practice, rest, and continuously iterate based on feedback. Life itself is a skill. Learn to live a great
   life or let life push you around -- the choice is up to you.

You might have noticed that all 4 areas have something in common, and that's how things are today is where you start and
where it ends is 100% completely up to you. Your life is in your own hands and no one else's -- no matter what happens
in the world or what others do to you. That's the essence of mastery in life.

Being happy and productive sometimes diverge, but both are necessary to sustain and achieve your full potential over a
lifetime. Metaphorically, think of happiness as the light from the sun that disperses in all directions from a power
core, while productivity is focusing all that light into a single point with high intensity to realize your dreams to
create prosperity. With them, like the sun, you are self-sustaining and super powerful, therefore you can accomplish anything you set your mind to and absolutely nothing can stop you.

Easily remember the steps using the acronym **BEES LOVE ABCD BEST** from the first letter of each step. **PUCT** for
the values pact. And **LICS** for mastery. Each step should be done in order so the next step is easier to do. It takes time to master each step, but the results are immediate and increasingly substantial. When things are not going as expected, take time to rest and reflect using the steps. Mastery is achieved when all steps are done naturally at all times. And voilà, a great life! :smile:
