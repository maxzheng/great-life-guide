Hello, adventurer! :smile:

I am going to tell you a sad but hopefully inspiring story about me and motivation behind [A Great Life Guide](http://agreatlife.guide/)
in hope that it will give you enough context to appreciate and better leverage it to live a great life!

Childhood Without Parental Guidance
-----------------------------------

I don't really remember my childhood much, but my dad passed away when I was around 8, and my mom got re-married to an
American Chinese, and hence my siblings and I ended up in the USA when I was 10. Because my mom was always working, and
our step-dad didn't really care much about us, I basically grew up without any parental guidance. I learned everything
from school and TV -- I watched too much TV, :sweat_smile:, since no one told me I shouldn't.

School Without Direction
------------------------

Luckily, I did well in school -- that's the only thing as I rarely socialized and sometimes got bullied for being the
nerd. I didn't really have any direction when it comes to what to do after high school. Thankfully I had the most
wonderful Computer Science teacher that encouraged me to apply for college, and so I applied to University of Central
Florida and got accepted with a full scholarship. It was one of the best schools in Florida for Computer Science. Alas, I
just didn't have any direction, nor motivation, so I switched majors a couple of times over a few years, but eventually
just stopped going.

Work and The Lowest Point of My Life
------------------------------------

I started to do different odd jobs here and there to get real world experiences, and eventually got referred to work
for a software company by my brother -- always thankful that he's always got my back. From there, things started to
became better as I enjoyed the work and did my job well that I kept switching roles as the company got acquired by
bigger and bigger companies, which is how I ended up in the Bay Area.

Before moving to the Bay Area, while things were going well professionally, my life was actually at its lowest
point as I have completely lost all motivation to live. I didn't know what's the point -- just doing work, coming home,
play some games, and sometimes get into relationships that end badly with a broken heart. I don't remember clearly
anymore, but I probably thought about suicide a few times to be done with the misery. Thankfully it was just flimsy
thoughts.

Marriage and Kids Giving Me New Hope
------------------------------------

Eventually, I came to the conclusion that since I don't have any use for my life, so I will just let someone else use it
instead of wasting it. Coincidentally, my mom was asking me to go back to China to get married, and so I went and got
married. It was a fun and exciting experience at first -- one of my best memories, but as you may have guessed, things
didn't go well after awhile.

When my daughter was born, something changed in me, I wanted to love, take care of her, and make sure she grows up
well with support and guidance that I didn't have. Eventually, we had a son too. While that more than doubled the amount
of work to take care of them, they are just so adorable, do the cutest things, and worth every effort.

More Work and The Midpoint of My Life
-------------------------------------

Eventually, I went to LinkedIn -- one of the best companies that I ever worked at. Unfortunately, I went there
with high hopes and the wrong mindset. While I did well in various jobs there, I wasn't too motivated due to various
circumstances at work and at home. It did pay off my mortgage, and so I am forever thankful for that. Interestingly,
during my last 2 weeks at Linkedin, it was then I started to see the bigger picture about work/life and [read about
compassion from Jeff Weiner](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20121015034012-22330283-managing-compassionately/). Yep,
while LinkedIn promoted compassion since Jeff, I didn't know until 4 years later as I was only doing what's needed for
my job and ignored everything else due to a lack of motivation. After I left, I realized I could have done so much more
and will consider going back to do just that some day.

When I started working at a new startup, I was super excited with high hopes as I was going to push myself to my limits
to see what I can accomplish and hopefully get rich too. :laughing: It was a great start and I loved the startup life and
the culture for the first few months and then conflicts started to happen at work and at home, and so I was sad
sometimes, which affected my productivity.

The Guide and The Highest Point of My Life
--------------------------------------

About 2 years ago is when I started writing [A Great Life Guide](http://agreatlife.guide/) as I figured things out in
terms of how to live not just a good life, but a great one. It would be a better-than-nothing backup for my kids if
something were to happen to me. And it would be useful to anyone that doesn't have parents or has misguided parents (as
they didn't have good guidance themselves either).

Every time I thought it was complete, real life conflicts quickly disproved it. Over the years, there were
[over 200 changes to the guide](https://github.com/maxzheng/great-life-guide) as I iterated logically and experimented
with different steps using myself as the guinea pig. It was finally completed a month ago as I was able to achieve 100%
happiness every day, which translates to 100% productivity, no matter what's happening in my life -- there were several
**serious** stressors at work and home due to COVID-19 lockdown, so it is battle tested.

It is not just me, but the benefits spew over to my family as well. My wife said I have become a completely different
person -- in a good way! :laughing: We haven't had any serious arguments since -- just small ones due to
misunderstanding. And my kids will figure out the right things to do whenever I remind them of the steps
in the guide -- hopefully, I don't have to remind them at some point. I am also able to connect and talk to anyone in my
past, even ones that I had serious conflicts with. And I feel happy to talk to them and genuinely want to help them
achieve happiness too.

As it works so well for me while my family have been in complete lockdown in our house for the past 6 months without a
single step out of the house (just backyard), I wanted to help others achieve 100% happiness and productivity as well --
no matter where they are and their situations. In 2020, there have been so many dramatic events that put traditional
thinking to the test and they are clearly failing. I believe the concepts in my guide can help bring the world to
unity so that humanity can truly prosper by working together as a whole. Therefore, my personal mission is to enable
everyone to be happy and productive.

My behaviors have changed *significantly* and the concepts in my guide is a bit *eccentric*, and so it hasn't been easy
to get people to listen and try out the steps in my guide -- even my wife, :laughing:. But just as it has done for me, I
believe anyone can achieve the same if they try -- it will take some time to master, so some patience is required (even
I am still adjusting to it).

Good luck and hope that you will try the steps and achieve 100% happiness and productivity every day for the rest of
your life. If you have any questions, just [connect and message me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxzheng/) and I am
happy to help for FREE -- yep, that's how much I believe in the guide and the value that it will unlock for humanity if
everyone leverages it.
