### Introduction: Becoming a Genius

Before we can become a genius in life, we have to know what life is. From a philosophical perspective,
Wikipedia has a very lengthy explanation on the [meaning of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life), but
in summary, the meaning is whatever that you want to be that makes you fulfilled, so you have full control of your
meaning and destiny -- and that's a beautiful and empowering thing. On a biological perspective, [Darwin's Theory of
Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) seems sound.

[Oxford Languages](https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/) defines a genius as:

> A person who is exceptionally intelligent or creative, either generally or in some particular respect.

For a long time, many believed that intelligence or creativity is something that you are born with. Based on
recent researches, while genes do play a role in some cases, generally they can be trained using the right skills and
techniques as our brains and bodies are extremely adaptable and powerful in all humans. There are abundant examples in
Daniel Coyle's book [The Talent Code](https://amzn.to/3jyCis4) where he explained talent is developed with the right
combination of ignition, master coaching, and deep practice. Read more under "Skill Development" in
[double.guide](http://double.guide)

> "If people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery," Michelangelo later said, "it would not seem so wonderful
> at all."


In history, there are also many examples of geniuses that started as normal or below average. Albert
Einstein was [slow in learning how to speak and had a mild form of autism](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1936731_1936743_1936745,00.html) when he was a child. Steve Jobs [started out as an ordinary guy that dropped out of
college](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc), but he believed in and applied himself, then he became a genius.

Anything is possible if you believe in and apply yourself!

### Unshackling Chains Holding You Back

There are many artificial or archaic beliefs and emotions that hold us back, such as fear of public speaking or that we
are not smart enough. In order for us to move at full speed, we need to unshackle us from those limiting beliefs and
emotions that are holding us to the ground.

The easiest way to do that is using the most powerful emotion at our disposal: Love. Simply love yourself completely,
including your fears, flaws, and failures, and they will naturally disappear in no time. Read more under "Love Yourself"
in [double.guide](http://double.guide).

### Gain Unlimited Energy with Happiness Intelligence

[Happiness Intelligence](https://www.longdom.org/proceedings/happiness-intelligence-hq--the-ability-to-be-happy-and-its-measurement-12348.html) is the ability to be happy. Once maximized, it's possible to go back to being happy again no matter what happens
in life, so happiness becomes a choice. Being happy without dependency will essentially give you unlimited energy to do
what's right and realize your dreams -- even if no one believes in you.

To maximize your happiness intelligence, follow the happiness steps in [A Great Life Guide](http://hp.guide):

1. Sleep well
2. Let go of everything
3. Enjoy the present
4. Nuture your drives with positivity

### Gain More Time with Productivity

Time is the most precious resource as it's finite. While we can't actually create more time, we can become more
productive so that we can do more in less time, therefore effectively gaining more time.

To become productive, follow the produtivity steps in [A Great Life Guide](http://hp.guide):

1. Activate your body, passion, and mind
2. Be present with acceptance
3. Concentrate on one thing at a time
4. Do the right thing

### Common Values for Ensuring the Prosperity of Humanity

Sharp tools has no affinity to the prosperity of humanity, hence it's important to have a common set of values to ensure
that as stated in [A Great Life Guide](http://hp.guide):

1. Truth: This is the foundation that everything else is built on. Without it, everything crumples.
2. Pleasure: We only have one life to live, so let's focus on enjoyment rather than pain. :)
3. Unity: This is what makes us human. The more we unite, the greater the humanity.

### Dreams that Make You Come Alive

All you need is happiness, but life becomes more exciting when you dream. As you have one life to live, make the most of
it by figuring out and live your dream every day. Read more under "Live Your Dream Life" in
[double.guide](http://double.guide).

Here are some tips to figure out your dream:

1. What are you most passionate about?
2. If you don't have to worry about money, what would you do?
3. What are you good at and your interests?

### Live Your Life to the Fullest Every Day

As we never know what will happen tomorrow, it's important to live each day to the fullest. In order to do that, we
should plan and do everything that's important to us in 24 hours. Carve out the number of hours that you want to spend
with your family, friends, career, hobbies, dreams, sleep, etc.
