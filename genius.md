### Introduction: You Can Be a Genius

Key Points:
* What is life and a genius?
* Intelligence, creativity, or any skill, can be developed.
* Many geniuses started out with normal capabilities in history.
* You can become a genius if you believe in and apply yourself!

Before we can become a genius in life, we have to know what life is. From a philosophical perspective,
Wikipedia has a very lengthy explanation on the [meaning of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life), but
in summary, the meaning is whatever that you want to be that makes you fulfilled, so you have full control of your
meaning and destiny -- and that's a beautiful and empowering thing. On a biological perspective, [Darwin's Theory of
Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) seems sound.

[Oxford Languages](https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/) defines a genius as:

> A person who is exceptionally intelligent or creative, either generally or in some particular respect.

For a long time, many believed that intelligence or creativity is something that you are born with. Based on
recent researches, while genes do play a role in some cases, generally they can be trained using the right skills and
techniques as our brains and bodies are extremely adaptable and powerful in all humans. There are abundant examples in
Daniel Coyle's book [The Talent Code](https://amzn.to/3jyCis4) where he explained talent is developed with the right
combination of ignition, master coaching, and deep practice. Read more under "Skill Development" in
[double.guide](http://double.guide)

> "If people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery," Michelangelo later said, "it would not seem so wonderful
> at all."


In history, there are also many examples of geniuses that started as normal or below average. Albert
Einstein was [slow in learning how to speak and had a mild form of autism](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1936731_1936743_1936745,00.html) when he was a child. Steve Jobs [started out as an ordinary guy that dropped out of
college](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc), but he believed in and applied himself, then he became a genius.

Anything is possible if you believe in and apply yourself!
