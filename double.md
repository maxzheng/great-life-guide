Memorizations
-------------

Did you know that you can easily remember vast amount of information quickly and easily? It's just a
matter of knowing how to do it. Your age or how well you can naturally remember things don't matter. Everyone can do it.
Once you know the techniques, you could easily [learn a new language](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-to-learn-a-language-in-less-than-24-hours-122194358/) in a day!

The memory techniques here can be combined together to remember massive and different kind of information easily.
All you have to do open your mind and give it a try.

### #1 How Memory Works

Memory works by associating what you already know. Visual memory is magnitudes better than other types of memory --
[90% of information processed in the brain are visuals and done at 60,000 times faster than text](https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/350326/studies-confirm-the-power-of-visuals-in-elearning).
All memory techniques work based on those two facts to enable you to remember unlimited amount of information easily.

### #2 Framework

[MOM by Jim Qwik](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-002/) will get you started on your memory journey:

* **Motivation**: To remember anything, there must be motivation. If you don't care, then it won't be remembered for
 long.
* **Observation**: Be mindful and concentrate to fully see and understand what you want to remember. If you don't see
 and understand, then there is nothing to remember.
* **Methods**: Use effective memorization techniques below as rote memorization is the least effective, but
 unfortunately is also the most widely used.

### #3 Stories & Links

[Story/Link System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_link_system) is easy and effective to remember ordered list
of items by creating a story with vivid images for each item.

Let's say we want to remember this list:

>    concentration, mindfulness, loving-kindness, prioritization, Pomodoro, Flow, FASTER, Tiny Habits.

You can easily do that by **visualizing the following story in your mind**:

>   In your room, imagine a con (**concentration**) man walks in to put a land mine
>   (**mindfulness**) in the middle of the room. You say to him "can you kindly (**loving-kindness**) leave please?"
>   So he looks at his watch and says "oh snap, I forgot about a prior (**prioritization**) engagement," and leaves while
>   taking your **Pomodoro** timer. You tried to follow (**Flow**) him, but he is **Faster** with his tiny hobbit feets
>   (**Tiny Habits**).

Now, close your eyes, and replay the story in your mind, and say the words from the list out loud as you do.
Congrats, you have just mastered the technique! The story can be as long as you need to remember an unlimited # of
items. The beauty of this is that you will be able to remember the story for a long time with just one iteration. To
make it more memorable, re-iterate with more vivid and wild images and make sure there is a strong link from one word
to the next.

To learn a new language or any one-to-one mapping, you can simply use the link part without the story. The French word
for chair is chaise. We can easily remember that by imagining a chair chasing (chaise) us.

### #4 Locations

[Loci Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) uses locations to associate to ordered or unordered
information that you want to remember. Location can be things in your room, your office, your body, your
neighborhood, or anything else that you know intimately. The idea is to put what you want to remember to each
location by doing a one-to-one mapping.

Let's try to remember a list of top 10 brain foods:

>    avocado, egg, walnut, blueberries, broccoli, coconut oil, leafy greens, turmeric, chocolate, fish

Map each of those items to our body like so by **visualizing them in your mind**:

* **Avocado** on top of egg head
* Crack the **egg** head to get **walnuts** inside
* **Coconut oil** coming out of your ears
* **Blueberries** coming out of your nose
* **Broccoli** coming out of your bronchus
* **Leafy greens** around your neck
* Your fingers look like **turmerics**
* **Chocolate** coming out of your butt
* Your feet smells like stinky **fish**

Now, you can go to any place on your body to find the item or go from top to bottom to get the full list.

### #5 Numbers

[Peg System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_peg_system) can be used to map items to numbers, which can be
useful for ordered or random retrieval. The idea is to map numbers to a word/image and then map that word/image to
what you want to remember.

First, we need to map numbers to a word/image, let's use these -- but you should use whatever comes natural to
you when you think of each number:

* Zero: Hero
* One: Sun
* Two: Twin
* Three: Tree
* Four: Door
* Five: Hive
* Six: Sticks
* Seven: Heaven
* Eight: Gate
* Nine: Vine

Then, remember the list of top brain foods in order like this by **visualizing them in your mind**:

* **Hero** eating **avocado** for breakfast
* **Sun** cooking **egg** on pavement
* **Twin** babies are climbing up walls and driving mom nuts (**walnuts**)
* **Tree** has lots of **coconuts [oil]**
* **Door** is made of **blueberries**
* **Hives** are being stuffed with **broccolis**
* **Sticks** have **leafy green** vegetables on it over a fire
* **Heaven** is passing out free **turmerics**
* **Gate** guard demands **chocolate** on entry
* **Vine** is wrapped around a **fish**.

Now, you can think of a number, which would map to the word/image, and from that, you can get the brain food. Randomly
select a number and you would get random access to any item. This method can be used to remember people's phone number
as well by making a story using those words starting with the person whose phone number you want to remember.


Executions
----------

These techniques will help you learn and do everything in half the time and double the enjoyment, so that you can have
more time to do anything else you like.

### #1 Learn Faster

[FASTER by Jim Qwik](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-001/) will help you learn anything faster and more effectively:

* **Forget** everything you know so they don't interfere with what you are about to learn.
* **Act** as you read by taking notes, memorize important content using memorization techniques, share with others. By
 doing active reading, you will remember better and gain better understanding.
* **State** of your mind matters. Make sure you are excited and motivated about the topic. Understand why you need to
 know and how it will be useful to you in the future. You will forget what you don't care sooner or later, but will
 remember things that matter to you for a lifetime.
* **Teach** others to further re-learn the content from another perspective.
* **Emotion** for the content matters as your brain will remember things with strong emotional attachment, and not so
  much otherwise. Evoke emotions and your senses as you learn to add more dimensions and connections to your memory.
* **Recall** what you know once awhile to re-enforce what you remembered.

Apply **FASTER** to your reading, studying, or whenever you are learning to learn faster!

### #2 Read Faster

The average reading speed is about 200 words per minute (WPM). Good readers double that to about 400 WPM.
Great readers double again to 800 WPM. The best readers surpass 1000 WPM. That's at least 5 times as fast as average
readers, which is a saving of 4 hours when reading a book that takes 5 hours!

Here are a couple of different ways to [improve your reading speed](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-007/):

1. **Comprehension must come first** before trying to increase your speed, otherwise there is no point going faster.
   To increase comprehension, it requires full concentration and use the **FASTER** and memory techniques to remember
   what you read. The last point to use memory techniques need to be stressed as there is no point reading faster or
   comprehend more if you don't remember the content long enough to use them!
2. **Stop the subvocalization** in your head as it reduces the reading speed to your speaking speed, which is much
   slower than your comprehension speed.
3. **Use your finger as a pacer** under the words you are reading, which can quickly increase your reading speed from
   25% to 100%. Read where your finger is and move your finger faster and faster, and then you will naturally start to
   read faster and reduce subvocalization too. Once you become really fast, then this can be skipped.
4. **Read in multiple words** [(single cohesive idea)](https://amzn.to/2ZyKArl)
   instead of one word at a time by grouping related words into a single idea or visual (e.g. super hero is strongest).
   When moving your eyes left to right, jump from one group of words to the next instead of moving smoothly.
   Try to use peripheral vision to read in more words -- this takes practice and time, but will let you reach 1000+ WPM.

If you are using a mobile app or electronic device, like Kindle, here are some tips:

1. Change the font size so that you can read the whole group of words in a single line, then just read from top to
   bottom smoothly (without moving your eyes left to right) and try to take in multiple lines at the same time if
   possible -- that is key to reading over 1000+ WPM.
2. Turn off smooth scrolling and flip to the next page instead so you don't need to re-locate where you are reading when
   scrolling.

### #3 Prioritization

[Prioritize](https://www.ctl.life/2018/03/too-many-things-to-do-5-simple-steps-to.html) work based on their value and
work on the most valuable things first as time is limited, so you get the most bang for your time.

For projects, use **TBD** to enable prioritization to maximize business impact:

* **Timeline Expectation** from stakeholders so projects are done on time.
* **Business Value** that will be realized when the project is done. Work on the highest value over cost ratio first.
* **Deliverables** are the key outputs of the project. It enables effort estimation and ensures expectations with
  stakeholders are met.

For meetings, attend only if you are providing/getting value and there is no way to do the same offline.

### #4 Optimal Concentration

[Pomodoro](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-019/) can be used to ensure concentration is at max when doing
work. Your ability to concentrate wanes after 30 minutes, so the idea is to take a break after 25 minutes of
concentrated work to reset using a timer. Instead of a timer, use mindfulness to check your
concentration and mental/body energy once awhile and take a break/refuel when it is not 100%.

Be sure to drink plenty of water and snack on some brain foods. And walking during the break will do wonders to your
butt, memory, and creativity.

### #5 Optimal Experience

[Flow](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-020/) can be used to fully immerse yourself in your work with
absolute passion and concentration, the work becomes so fun that time simply flies as your productivity sky rockets
to new heights!! This is the pinnacle of productivity and the final state that you want to achieve to get things done
fast with high quality.

To get into the state, these conditions must be met (**PCCC**):

* **Positive Feedbacks**: There should be immediate positive feedback to your brain from what you are doing to encourage
  continuation, which will eventually lead to flow state.
* **Clear Goal**: There must be a clear goal in mind, otherwise the mind would wander. The more specific the better.
* **Challenging**: The work should be challenging, but not too hard. Too easy, then there is no need for flow state.
 Too hard, then it won't flow. There is a sweet spot somewhere. If the challenge is too hard, break it down into
 something easier. If it is too easy, well, find something more challenging to do, LOL!
* **Concentration Time**: It takes about 15 to 45 minutes of concentrated work to get into the flow state, so don't
 let yourself be distracted during that time. The use of Pomodoro technique is encouraged and won't affect your flow
 state as long as the break is short (less than 5 minutes).

Listening to your favorite music can help too.

### #6 Behavior Design

[Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg, PhD](https://amzn.to/37YyHyK) can be used to build good habits to automate your life, which
can be used to improve your health and learning.

Easily create new habits using **ABC**:

* **Anchor**: Find something that you already do
* **Behavior**: Do something small that you want to turn into a habit
* **Celebrate**: Generate a good feeling and praise yourself.

For example, to build a habit of doing exercise in the morning after you get a drink of water (something you already
do), then immediately do something small towards your exercise goals (such as putting on shoes or taking one step),
and finally make yourself feel good and praise yourself for completing the small step. Repeat the same process
several times, and it will become a tiny habit. Repeat it to do more exercise each time, then it can become a big habit.

Use **B=MAP** (Behavior = Motivation * Ability * Prompt) to easily change an existing one. Want to reduce picking up
your phone to check messages? Make it harder to access your phone (reduce ability).

### #7 Public Speaking

[3 golden rules](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20121022044446-22330283-from-crickets-chirping-to-a-standing-ovation-three-rules-of-effective-public-speaking/) from Jeff Weiner:

* **Know your audience**: Different audiences have different goals and the content needs to be relevant and valuable to
  them.
* **Know your material**: The reason they are listening to you is because you know about the topic more than them,
  otherwise there is no reason for them to be there.
* **Know your passion**: The most interesting topic presented without enthusiasm will put people to sleep. The most
  boring topic will come alive when presented and infused with passion as it is transferred to your audience.

[Speak using **HAIL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI) (by Julian Treasure) so people will listen:

* **Honesty**: The truth matters and lies don't.
* **Authenticity**: Be yourself as they came to hear from **you**.
* **Integrity**: Do what you say otherwise they will feel betrayed
* **Love**: Show that you care and they will care about what you say

### #8 Parallel Thinking

[Six Thinking Hats by Edward de Bono](https://amzn.to/2YYdkLd) will help you or your team solve problems using parallel
thinking from six perspectives, thereby increasing the number of solutions and concensus in half the time or less:

1. **White**: Discuss using *pure* facts and information.
2. **Red**: Discuss using intuition and feelings, like *anger*. It's ok to be illogical.
3. **Black**: Discuss *negatively* with caution.
4. **Yellow**: Discuss positively with optimism like a ray of *sunshine*.
5. **Green**: Discuss using creativity, innovation, and new ideas with *growth* mindset.
6. **Blue**: Control the discussion and look at everything from the *sky* above. Start and end with blue.

Together, each person should put on each hat in the same sequence to brainstorm so the collective brain power of the
team can be used to solve the problem rather than arguing about who is right / better.

### #9 Hacking Motivation

When you feel motivated, that is actually dopamine being released, which makes you feel really good and happy. In order
to [hack it to your advantage](https://medium.com/@ozandagdeviren/hacking-your-brain-to-use-dopamine-for-success-ed2d352b4874),
there are a couple of things to keep in mind:

1. There must be a future reward that you are excited about. The amount of dopamine released when you receive the
   reward is significantly lower than before. This is the carrot. E.g. big paycheck.
2. Once you start doing work while thinking about the reward, that's when significant amount of dopamine is released,
   which gives you the motivation needed to get the work done. And it will continue to do so until the work is done, and
   then dramatically decreases until the reward is received.
3. To get an extra boost of dopamine, give yourself mini-rewards once awhile, but not always, which is less effective.
4. Many factors could significantly impact dopamine release or its effect, such as stress, pain, lack of sleep.

Your brain naturally trains you to do things that it thinks will help you live a better life by releasing dopamine, such
as making friends. Now you know how you can train your brain to do what you want!

### #10 Effective Communication

The most effective communication should convey emotions.

I believe emotion is our first/native language before we learned to speak.
Other languages / forms of communication need to be translated by our brains to native forms, such as emotions or
memories, before we can understand and respond. Therefore, the best way to communicate is by using our first/native
language as it is the most direct. Unfortunately, there is no way to do it directly, so we must use intermediate forms,
such as speech, writing, or gesturing. However, the idea is to make sure emotions are being conveyed thru those means to
improve the effectiveness of the communication. Logical reasoning, pretty words, and any other form of communications
falter in the face of emotions.

Here are a few tips on how to convey emotions, therefore communicate effectively (**UMGGG**):

1. **Use multiple forms**: You do this naturally when speak in person as you use your voice, face, and body to convey
   additional information that gets translated to emotions. When communicating online via text, using images, emojis, or
   a unique writing style are great ways to add extra dimensions. And humor goes a long way! :smile:
2. **Mastery of forms**: In order to translate your emotions fully and correctly, you need to have mastery of the
   forms of communication that you use, otherwise mistranslation and misinterpretation will happen.
3. **Good Visuals**: Visual is a native form that can be easily understood and remembered, therefore it is more
   effective than words. A picture is worth a thousand words. In absence of real visuals, use words to describe them.
3. **Good Values**: If something is not interesting, then we will naturally tune out. But if something is interesting
   (i.e. provides value), then we will listen closely. Hence, to ensure your audience is all ears, the content must
   provide value to them. The more valuable the content, the more they will listen.
4. **Good Intentions**: If the audience detects malicious intent, then they will distrust you and disengage. People will
   listen if they know you are trying to help them and not just to take advantage of them.

If the goal is to get your audience to act, then apply behavior design using
[Tiny Habits](https://amzn.to/37YyHyK)'s **B=MAP**: Behavior = Motivation * Ability * Prompt.

You must listen to others first if you want them to listen to you. Listen to their needs, values, desires,
their pains, their joys, their feedbacks, or anything else on their mind. After you have listened, acknowledged, then
you can respond with content that is relevant and valuable to them.

### #11 Lateral Thinking

Thinking logically is called vertical thinking as you are focused in a single subject and is great for tactical work.
For strategic and new ideas, it is better to think from diffused, eagle-in-the-sky, different, and untrod
perspectives, and let your brain come up with a novel solution for you. That is called lateral thinking, which is
defined and written in the book [Lateral Thinking](https://amzn.to/3iTBw9p) by Edward De Bono.

In the book, he described the following scenario to demonstrate lateral thinking:

> A merchant owes a banker a lot of money and the banker fancies the merchant's daughter, and so the banker offered
> them a deal using a game of chance. The banker will put a black and white pebble into a box and if the daughter picks
> the white pebble, then the debt is cleared. If she picks the black one, then the daughter will be traded for the debt.
> And if they don't play the game, then the merchant will go to jail for not being able to pay the debt. After they
> decided to play, the sly banker puts in two black pebbles into the box instead of one each, and the daughter saw it.

So now, logically, she has 3 options:

1. Don't play, but then her dad goes to jail.
2. Confront the banker, but things probably won't go well.
3. Play and exchange herself for the debt to save her dad.

None of them are good choices. Can you think of a better option? It will be hard logically using vertical
thinking. Pause here and try to think about a solution before reading further so that you can better appreciate lateral
thinking.

Edward suggests there are 4 things to improve lateral thinking:

1. **Avoid the dominance of vertical thinking**. As most people are trained to think logically since grade school, it's
   easy to get into the old habit. The more that you are an expert and comfortable with the existing thinking, the less
   likely that you would see a new way. So it's important to forget what you know. Most smart people are stuck in
   vertical thinking and so can't come up with out-of-the-box ideas easily.
2. **Try abstracting the problem in different ways or more generically**. What you see may not be what it seems.
   Something that looks like a square outline may be just 4 lines, and then the 4 lines may be just many dots, and so
   the square is actually just many dots in the shape of a square outline. Once you find the base abstraction, then you
   can solve the problem differently.
3. **Search from different perspectives and in untrod paths.** While the existing solution may be good, but if you
   don't look around for other paths, then you will never know if there is a better one. So ignore the existing path and
   look for another one with fresh eyes, and you will be surprised. Or look at things backward or from another
   perspective.
4. **Chance is better than you think.** Lastly, just leave things to chance. Many great discoveries of our time happened
   by chance. While you can't use it directly, but like card games, you can improve your odds. One way is by playing
   more and just explore. Another is to brainstorm crazy ideas even if it doesn't make sense logically.

Now that you know how to be a better lateral thinker, can you think of a solution? Hint: Try to think backward and
what's left in the box rather than what to take and a solution might just come to you. :wink:

To be the next Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, or the big ideas guy in your team, become a lateral thinker!

Trainings
---------

Use these techniques/tips to improve your body, concentration, awareness, compassion, gratitude, and reduce negativities
(e.g. stress, anger), which will greatly improve your physical / mental health, memorization, execution, relationships,
leadership, happiness, and productivity!

Yep, meditation and exercise can do miracles for your body and mind! So don't underestimate their benefits and do
start doing them today.

### #1 Concentration Meditation

[Concentration Meditation](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-Concentration-Meditation) will improve your concentration and
reduce stress, therefore improving your memory, execution, and health.

Here's how to do it:
1. Sit/lay down in a comfortable spot, and relax your body
2. Focus on your breath or anything else as long as it doesn't change.
3. If any thoughts or other distractions comes up, just gently let them go and return to the object of focus -- this is
   natural and will always happen, so no need to fight it.
4. Repeat until you feel fully relaxed and able to concentrate.

It takes time to master this skill so be patient.

### #2 Mindfulness Meditation

[Mindfulness Meditation](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-Mindful-Meditation) will improve your awareness, concentration,
and reduce stress, therefore improving your ability to perceive, understand, and enjoy life.

Here's how to do it:
1. Either sit/lay down in a comfortable spot or while you do things during the day in any position, and relax yourself.
2. Bring your focus to what you are doing to fully enjoy it and then diffuse the focus to everything around you to fully
   take them in and appreciate the beauty.
3. Shift your focus to your different senses so you don't miss anything.
4. For any emotion or thought that comes up, enjoy, accept, let them go and don't let them affect you.
5. Scan your body from top to bottom once awhile to feel the sensations, relax, and put them into the correct posture.
6. Repeat until you feel relaxed and aware of everything in and around you.

This can be done while you exercise, sitting in front of your desk while working, walking to the bathroom, etc. You will
start to see the world anew and notice things that was once ignored.

### #3 Loving-Kindness Meditation

[Loving-Kindess Meditation](https://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Loving-Kindness-Meditation-%28Metta%29) will improve
your compassion, gratitude, concentration, and reduce negativities, therefore improving your relationships,
leadership, and happiness.

Here's how to do it:
1. Sit/lay down in a comfortable spot, and relax your body
2. Acknowledge that you are a person and you deserve to be happy just like everyone else, forgive yourself for any
   wrongdoing, praise yourself for the good things you have done, thank yourself for what you contribute to others, and
   finally extend agape and well wishes to yourself.
3. Now repeat the same steps for some people you love, some you had conflicts with, and some that you don't know that
   well.
4. Repeat until you are relaxed and your heart is filled with warmth, love, gratitude, and happiness.

### #4 Exercise

Do cardio exercises for at least 30 minutes a day to boost your happiness, mental and physical health, improve brain
functions and memory, sleep, energy levels, and [many more](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise),
therefore productivity too. Just walking can [improve working memory and increase creativity by 60%](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/153-3-kwik-tips-for-brain-exercise/id1208024744?i=1000456008448)!

As you age, you naturally become less active and many parts of your body start to degrade, hence it becomes more
critical to do exercise. When you exercise, it increases the amount of blood and oxygen to your brain to boost its
energy and function, and at the same time, remove toxins that damages your body and brain.
It can [slow down and even reverse some effects of aging](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercise-and-aging-can-you-walk-away-from-father-time)!

Don't like to exercise? No problem. Easily make it into a habit using [Tiny Habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8).

### #4 Sleep Well

Sleeping well is [the most important step](http://agreatlife.guide/) to live a happy and productive life. Nothing works
without it. It builds long-term memory, promotes health and growth of your body and mind, clears out toxins / stress,
and [many other important functions](https://www.health.qld.gov.au/news-events/news/7-amazing-things-that-happen-to-your-body-while-you-sleep) to keep you running at your optimal state.

In order to get the best sleep, follow **Emc²**:

1. **Exercise in the day**, aside from many health benefits, is proven to [promote higher quality of sleep](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sleep-exercise-sleep-in-america_n_2784457). One time, I had to shovel dirt back to my yard for a few hours after my wife
   paid someone to remove too much, and I slept like a baby that night -- best sleep in my life, :laughing:. It is most
   effective when it is a full body exercise.
2. **Meditate before bed** to clear out distractions that keep you up.
3. **Comfortable in bed** and make sure there isn't anything around you that would wake you up during the middle of the
   night. You should be nice and warm in your blanket. There shouldn't be any sporadic loud noises or bright light.
4. **Consistently sleep/wake up at the same time** to get your body into a rhythmic sleep cycle, so it becomes a habit.
   Depending on your age, there is a different [recommended number of hours](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times/page/0/1)
   to sleep, such as 8 hours for adults or 10+ hours for kids, to get the best results. If you don't need to, don't use
   an alarm clock, but listen to your body. Sometimes, you will need more sleep to fully rejuvenate, such as when you
   are sick.

Leaderships
-----------

There is only so much you can do by yourself. With leadership, you can easily multiple your impact by 10 to **billions of
times** by inspiring others to join your mission.

### #1 Transcendence

There are many leadership styles, but the best one is
[transcendent leadership](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2018/05/01/how-to-stop-being-a-boss-and-become-a-transcendent-leader)
where you instill meaning and purpose to your employees based on the company's mission [with compassion](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/linkedin-ceo-how-compassion-can-build-a-better-company/)
so they will care about you, the company, the company's mission, and do amazing things.

[Fred Kofman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkofman/)'s book [The Meaning Revolution](https://amzn.to/3ekx28m) details how
transcendent leadership can be used to manage these 4 key issues in an organization:

1. **Disengagement**: 90% of the global workforce is disengaged, which means a lot of lost productivity, money being
   dropped on the floor, and no one is picking it up. Traditional leadership, like the carrots and sticks approach,
   just demotivates employees and makes things worst, but many leaders still use it. To really motivate employees, there
   must be *purpose* to provide meaning, *principles* to ensure integrity, *people* to build safe/good relationships, and
   *autonomy* to enable creative freedom.
2. **Disorganization**: Different business units are fighting with others to win, but the organization is always loosing
   in that kind of situation. Local and global incentives can't solve the problems and sometimes can make things worst
   (i.e. only local incentives is ok but not enough).
3. **Disinformation**: Different people / teams have different information and they are not always willing to share. Even
   if they do try, it is still easy to misinterpret. In short, it's just almost impossible to have all perfect
   information to make the best decision.
4. **Disillusion**: If you talk and forget to walk, that can easily lead to disengagement.
   It's important to enable employees to provide honest feedbacks to leadership so improvement can be made. And power
   can be addictive and ruin you if it isn't put in check.

All organizations have those problems and there is no way to fix them completely, but you just need to manage them
better than your competitors using a well designed culture, compassion, and transcendent leadership.

If you feel the need to micromanage, that means you haven't put transcendent leadership to good use yet!

This is practiced by [Jeff Weiner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08/), one of the world's best CEOs, leaders at
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/) and [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/) as [Fred
Kofman was the VP of Leadership Development](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkofman/) at both companies.

### #2 Network

Does a tree make a sound when it falls in the forest when no one is there? Technically, yes, but the idea is that if no
one is there, then it doesn't matter. Same applies to your career or personal mission. If no one is there to see what
you do, then nothing really happened from other people's perspective even if something did. Therefore, the more people
that can see and help you, the larger your impact. So go out and build your professional and personal network! The
bigger the better -- just make sure there's value on both sides for a long lasting relationship.

Your network can provide you with new opportunities -- my last 3 jobs were based on my connections' recommendations. It
can provide you with professional/personal development and knowledge sharing -- this is highly under valued. As others
are happy to share and there are no limits, it is the best and largest economy of value exchange where you can take as
much as you want without a need to give back -- you should be thankful, of course. However, if you do want to give back,
it is definitely appreciated. Everyone wins no matter what!

As LinkedIn's cofounder [Reid Hoffman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reidhoffman/) always say,
[relationships matter](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20121106193412-1213-why-relationships-matter-i-to-the-we/).

### #3 Compassion

All great leaders lead with compassion. It's not easy, but worth it.

Jeff Weiner, one of the world's best CEOs, taught me compassion in his article [Managing
Compassionately](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20121015034012-22330283-managing-compassionately/). My life was forever
changed from that moment on. I began to feel the pains of others and truly feel connected to everyone. I was able to
understand others better and truly want to help them whenever they need. And the relationships that I build have
substance, endurance, and are mutually beneficial.

But that didn't happen overnight, but in three phases over a span of 3 years:

1. **Understanding compassion**. Empathy and compassion are often defined differently depending on who you talk to.
   Prudy Gourguechon [defines empathy as a neutral function](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prudygourguechon/2017/12/26/empathy-is-an-essential-leadership-skill-and-theres-nothing-soft-about-it/#2307e6c92b9d)
   where you *understand* what the other person is going through from their perspective, but may or may not help.
   Compassion builds on top of empathy where you *feel* what the other person is going through with the intention of
   helping them.
2. **Feeling what the other person is going through**. This is the hard part because most people will naturally retract
   themselves when they start to feel other people's sufferings, hence most leaders tend to stop at empathy as it is
   easier. The first time I went through this, it lasted about a year before I retracted as I wasn't even able to
   handle my own sufferings, so how can I handle others too? Before doing this, ensure you have a strong self (i.e.
   solid happiness core). To improve myself, I started writing [A Great Life Guide](http://agreatlife.guide/) two years
   ago, which was finally complete last month. With it, I was able to achieve 100% happiness every day and handle my own
   sufferings along with everyone else's. With the guide, you should be able to do it in a matter of days instead of years.
3. **Helping others.** When we show others that we *care* about them, then they will also *care* about you and therefore
   will listen and help you as well. Win/win for both. If you don't help others, then you don't really care about them.
   When people know that you don't care, they won't care either and will only do the minimal or nothing for you. Without
   caring, motivation wanes and the relationship won't last.

Therefore, to bring out the best of people, you must manage compassionately. The greater the number of people that you
extend your compassion to, the greater your leadership. The greatest leadership extends compassion to everyone. :heart:

A word of caution, as Fred Kofman told Jeff once:

> Compassion without wisdom is foolish. Wisdom without compassion is ruthless.

Empowerments
------------

You can achieve your dreams -- the only requirement is that you have to believe in and apply yourself!

### #1 Believe In Yourself

Believe in yourself. And if you don't believe yourself, how do you expect others to do that? While it might seem
insignificant, but it has [massive impact on what you can accomplish](https://youtu.be/pN34FNbOKXc) as your brain will
wire itself based on what you believe. If you believe it is not possible to remember massive amount of information or
become a genius, then you won't. If you believe the world is flat, then it is. If you don't believe it is possible to
fly into space, then you won't. But if you believe you can do anything by applying yourself using the right
skills/techniques/tips, then you will!  Believe is scientifically proven to [alter the effects of medication, diet,
exercise, and even stress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tqq66zwa7g) in your body and mind. So believe in yourself
and positivity.

[Limitless by Jim Qwik](https://amzn.to/37NVptj) is the best book ever written and is also the mindset that you want
to have when it comes to what you can do. There is essentially no limit to your brain's ability to abstract, process,
and remember information. While your body has physical limits, but it is amazingly adaptive. Both your body
and mind can be trained and it will adapt to all your needs, known as [neutroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity).

The only [differences between an average person and a genius](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-032/) are:

* **Growth**: You must have a growth and limitless mindset where you are motivated to learn and become better each
 day. The techniques in this article will get you started.
* **Giving**: Teach others what you have learned so everyone becomes better. Someone taught you, remember?
* **Gratitude**: Be thankful for everything you have got and everyone that have helped you be the awesome person you
 are today. It takes a village to raise a child.
* **Grit**: It's not a matter of knowing, but you must do it and never stop. Perserverance is key and
 things do get easier, especially if you use the techniques in this article.

Steve Jobs [started out as an ordinary guy, but he believed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc) and applied
himself, then he became a genius. So you can too!

### #2 Happiness is Purely Internal

Happiness is an internal state that you can decide and must be that way to ensure you have unlimited energy to be
productive. If you are not happy at all, productivity goes to zero. It is the single most significant factor to
productivity. To be happy and productive at all times, simply follow [A Great Life Guide](http://agreatlife.guide/).

> Happiness enables productivity. Productivity elevates happiness.

### #3 Aim for The Biggest Impact & Growth

Don't take the easiest job, nor the hardest, as neither is good for you. Too easy, and you won't grow. Too hard, there
is no chance to grow. Pick one that is challenging with the highest impact and
[growth potential](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means), but still doable, and
you will be rewarded handsomely in both monetary and non-monetary rewards. And don't be afraid to fail -- that's one of
the best ways to grow!!

### #4 Be a Player, Not a Victim

The idea comes from [Fred Kofman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkofman/)'s book [The Meaning Revolution](https://amzn.to/3fWHQL9)
where he states that a victim mindset always blame others and external forces for his misfortune, on a contrary, a
player places himself as part of the problem and puts everything under his control so he decides what to
do and outcome.

For example, if you are late for a meeting, do you say "sorry, the meeting ran over?" Well, that's a victim's mindset as
you are blaming the meeting for making you late. A player would say "sorry, **I** need to stay longer in the meeting, so
I will be late" before he's late or "sorry, **I** missed the meeting alert, but won't happen again." as he will make
changes needed to ensure he doesn't miss the alert again. Do you see the stark differences the approaches that were
taken between the two mindsets? A victim simply blames others without fixing the problem, however a player always
takes responsibility and fixes the problem so it doesn't happen again as everything is under his control.

Problems have a negative connotation and generally people steer away from them, but it's actually better to think of
them as challenges that reward us. For each challenge, while it might not be fun sometimes, the key outcome is that you
become stronger at the end -- either you learned something new or become more resilient, so you can take on bigger
challenges in the future. Therefore, don't run away from them, but accept and complete them with excitement and be
thankful for the experience and the reward!

A player's mindset is what you want to be have for your life -- everything is always under your control and it is
always your responsibility and never others. Blaming others is just an excuse for poor planning and gives up
responsibility and control of your life to others. You don't want to do that. It's your life, so be the player and accept
all the challenges that will make you stronger and take full responsibility and control of the outcome -- your outcome!

### #5 Leverage What Others Have Learned

If you try to figure out everything yourself, it would take you millions of years as that's how much knowledge has
accumulated since the dawn of humanity. And that continues to grow each day as
[human knowledge is doubling every year](https://www.industrytap.com/knowledge-doubling-every-12-months-soon-to-be-every-12-hours/3950).
How do you obtain millions of years of wisdom while it doubles every year? Easy, as you may have guessed,
that's by reading what they have written and listening to what they say using all the techniques that you have
learned in this guide. By doing that, you can leverage all they have learned and use that to do your bidding -- that's
smart, not hard!

[Bill Gates and many other successful CEOs read daily and
often](https://www.blinkist.com/magazine/posts/most-ceos-read-60-books-per-year). Bill reads 50 books a year. Elon Musk
learned to build rockets by reading books. Warren Buffett reads 500 pages every day. In the book [Change Your Habits, Change Your
Life](https://amzn.to/2ZWBPYs), which has strategies that transformed 177 average people into self-made millionaires, it
found that 88% of financially successful people read at least 30 mins per day.

Of course, it's impossible to read everything and listen to everyone, so you do need to focus on some based on
your interests. If you are short on time, try out [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/) where they provide a summary of
key points in many books. I prefer to read the original as it provides more context. In Amazon's Kindle app, the
`Send a Free Sample` option is a great way to preview before you buy!
