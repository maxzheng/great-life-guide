Empowerments
------------

You can achieve your dreams -- the only requirement is that you have to believe in and apply yourself!

### #1 Believe

Believe in yourself. And if you don't believe yourself, how do you expect others to do that? While it might seem
insignificant, but it has [massive impact on what you can accomplish](https://youtu.be/pN34FNbOKXc) as your brain will
wire itself based on what you believe. If you believe it is not possible to remember massive amount of information or
become a genius, then you won't. If you believe the world is flat, then it is. If you don't believe it is possible to
fly into space, then you won't. But if you believe you can do anything by applying yourself using the right
skills/techniques/tips, then you will!  Believe is scientifically proven to [alter the effects of medication, diet,
exercise, and even stress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tqq66zwa7g) in your body and mind. So believe in yourself
and positivity.

[Limitless by Jim Qwik](https://amzn.to/37NVptj) is the best book ever written and is also the mindset that you want
to have when it comes to what you can do. There is essentially no limit to your brain's ability to abstract, process,
and remember information. While your body has physical limits, but it is amazingly adaptive. Both your body
and mind can be trained and it will adapt to all your needs, known as [neutroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity).

The only [differences between an average person and a genius](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-032/) are:

* **Growth**: You must have a growth and limitless mindset where you are motivated to learn and become better each
 day. The techniques in this article will get you started.
* **Giving**: Teach others what you have learned so everyone becomes better. Someone taught you, remember?
* **Gratitude**: Be thankful for everything you have got and everyone that have helped you be the awesome person you
 are today. It takes a village to raise a child.
* **Grit**: It's not a matter of knowing, but you must do it and never stop. Perserverance is key and
 things do get easier, especially if you use the techniques in this article.

Steve Jobs [started out as an ordinary guy, but he believed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc) and applied
himself, then he became a genius. So you can too!

### #2 Happiness

Happiness is an internal state that you can decide and must be that way to ensure you have unlimited energy to be
productive. If you are not happy at all, productivity goes to zero. It is the single most significant factor to
productivity. To be happy and productive at all times, simply follow [A Great Life Guide](http://agreatlife.guide/).

### #3 Biggest Impact & Growth

Don't take the easiest job, nor the hardest, as neither is good for you. Too easy, and you won't grow. Too hard, there
is no chance to grow. Pick one that is challenging with the highest impact and
[growth potential](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means), but still doable, and
you will be rewarded handsomely in both monetary and non-monetary rewards. And don't be afraid to fail -- that's one of
the best ways to grow!!

### #4 Be a Player, Not a Victim

The idea comes from [Fred Kofman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkofman/)'s book [The Meaning Revolution](https://amzn.to/3fWHQL9)
where he states that a victim mindset always blame others and external forces for his/her misfortune, on a contrary, a
player places himself/herself as part of the problem and puts everything under his/her control so he/her decides what to
do and outcome.

For example, if you are late for a meeting, do you say "sorry, the meeting ran over?" Well, that's a victim's mindset as
you are blaming the meeting for making you late. A player would say "sorry, **I** need to stay longer in the meeting, so
I will be late" before he's late or "sorry, **I** missed the meeting alert, but won't happen again." as he will make
changes needed to ensure he doesn't miss the alert again. Do you see the stark differences the approaches that were
taken between the two mindsets? A victim simply blames others without fixing the problem, however a player always
takes responsbility and fixes the problem so it doesn't happen again as everything is under his control.

Problems have a negative connotation and generally people steer away from them, but it's actually better to think of
them as challenges that reward us. For each challenge, while it might not be fun sometimes, the key outcome is that you
become stronger at the end -- either you learned something new or become more resilient, so you can take on bigger
challenges in the future. Therefore, don't run away from them, but accept and complete them with excitement and be
thankful for the experience and the reward!

A player's mindset is what you want to be have for your life -- everything is always under your control and it is
always your responsibility and never others. Blaming others is just an excuse for poor planning and gives up
responsibility and control of your life to others. You don't want to do that. It's your life, so be the player and accept
all the challenges that will make you stronger and take full responsibility and control of the outcome -- your outcome!

Memorizations
-------------

Did you know that you can easily remember vast amount of information quickly and easily? It's just a
matter of knowing how to do it. Your age or how well you can naturally remember things don't matter. Everyone can do it!
Once you know the techniques, you could easily [learn a new language](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-to-learn-a-language-in-less-than-24-hours-122194358/) in a day!

The memory techniques here can be combined together to remember massive and different kind of information easily.
All you have to do open your mind and give it a try.

### #1 How Memory Works

Memory works by associating what you already know and
[visual memory](https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/350326/studies-confirm-the-power-of-visuals-in-elearning)
is magnitudes better than other types of memory.
All memory techniques work based on those two facts to enable you to remember unlimited amount of information easily!

### #2 Framework

[MOM by Jim Qwik](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-002/) will get you started on your memory journey:

* **Motivation**: To remember anything, there must be motivation. If you don't care, then it won't be remembered for
 long.
* **Observation**: Be mindful and concentrate to fully see and understand what you want to remember. If you don't see
 and understand, then there is nothing to remember.
* **Methods**: Use effective memorization techniques below as rote memorization is the least effective, but
 unfortunately is also the most widely used.

### #3 Stories & Links

[Story/Link System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_link_system) is easy and effective to remember ordered list
of items by creating a story with vivid images for each item.

Let's say we want to remember this list:

>    concentration, mindfulness, loving-kindness, prioritization, Pomodoro, Flow, FASTER, Tiny Habits.

You can easily do that by **visualizing the following story in your mind**:

>   In your room, imagine a con (**concentration**) man walks in to put a land mine
>   (**mindfulness**) in the middle of the room. You say to him "can you kindly (**loving-kindness**) leave please?"
>   So he looks at his watch and says "oh snap, I forgot about a prior (**prioritization**) engagement," and leaves while
>   taking your **Pomodoro** timer. You tried to follow (**Flow**) him, but he is **Faster** with his tiny hobbit feets
>   (**Tiny Habits**).

Now, close your eyes, and replay the story in your mind, and say the words from the list out loud as you do.
Congrats, you have just master the technique! The story can be as long as you need to remember an unlimited # of
items. The beauty of this is that you will be able to remember the story for a long time with just one iteration. To
make it more memorable, re-iterate with more vivid and wild images and make sure there is a strong link from one word
to the next.

To learn a new language or any one-to-one mapping, you can simply use the link part without the story. The French word
for chair is chaise. We can easily remember that by imagining a chair chasing (chaise) us.

### #4 Locations

[Loci Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) uses locations to associate to ordered or unordered
information that you want to remember. Location can be things in your room, your office, your body, your
neighborhood, or anything else that you know intimately. The idea is to put what you want to remember to each
location by doing a one-to-one mapping.

Let's try to remember a list of top 10 brain foods:

>    avocado, egg, walnut, blueberries, broccoli, coconut oil, leafy greens, tumeric, chocolate, fish

Map each of those items to our body like so by **visualizing them in your mind**:

* Avocado on top of egg head
* Crack the egg head to get walnuts inside
* Coconut oil coming out of your ears
* Blueberries coming out of your nose
* Brocolli coming out of your bronchus
* Leafy greens around your neck
* Your fingers are replaced by tumerics
* Chocolate coming out of your butt
* Your feet smells like stinky fish

Now, you can go to any place on your body to find the item or go from top to bottom to get the full list.

### #5 Numbers

[Peg System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_peg_system) can be used to map items to numbers, which can be
useful for ordered or random retrieval. The idea is to map numbers to a word/image and then map that word/image to
what you want to remember.

First, we need to map numbers to a word/image, let's use these -- but you should use whatever comes natural to
you when you think of each number:

* Zero: Hero
* One: Sun
* Two: Twin
* Three: Tree
* Four: Door
* Five: Hive
* Six: Sticks
* Seven: Heaven
* Eight: Gate
* Nine: Vine

Then, remember the list of top brain foods in order like this by **visualizing them in your mind**:

* Hero eating avocado for breakfast
* Sun cooking egg on pavement
* Twin babies are climbing up walls and driving mom nuts (walnuts)
* Tree has lots of coconuts [oil]
* Door is made of blueberries
* Hives are being stuffed by bees with broccolis
* Sticks have leafy green vegetables on it over a fire
* Heaven is passing out free tumerics
* Gate guard demands chocolate on entry
* Vine is wrapped around a fish.

Now, you can think of a number, which would map to the word/image, and from that, you can get the brain food. Randomly
select a number and you would get random access to any item. This method can be used to remember people's phone number
as well by making a story using those words starting with the person whose phone number you want to remember.

Executions
----------

These techniques will help you learn and do everything in half the time and double the enjoyment, so that you can have
more time to do anything else you like!

### #1 Learn Faster

[FASTER by Jim Qwik](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-001/) will help you learn faster and more effectively:

* **Forget** everything you know so they don't interfere with what you are about to learn.
* **Act** as you read by taking notes, memorize important content using memorization techniques, share with others. By
 doing active reading, you will remember better and gain better understanding.
* **State** of your mind matters. Make sure you are excited and motivated about the topic. Understand why you need to
 know and how it will be useful to you in the future. You will forget what you don't care sooner or later, but will
 remember things that matter to you for a life time.
* **Teach** others to further re-learn the content from another perspective.
* **Emotion** for the content matters as your brain will remember things with strong emotional attachment, and not so
  much otherwise. Evoke emotions and your senses as you learn to add more dimensions and connections to your memory!
* **Recall** what you know once awhile to re-enforce what you remembered.

Apply **FASTER** to your reading, studying, or whenever you are learning to learn faster!

### #2 Read Faster

Here are a couple of different ways to [improve your reading speed](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-007/):

1. Comprehension must come first before trying to increase your speed, otherwise there is no point going faster.
   To increase comprehension, it requires full concentration and use the **FASTER** and memory techniques to remember
   what you read.
2. Stop the subvocalization in your head as it reduces the reading speed to your speaking speed, which is much slower
   than your comprehension speed.
3. Use your finger as a pacer under the words you are reading, which can quickly increase your reading speed from 25% to
   100%. Read where your finger is and move your finger faster and faster, and then you will naturally start to read
   faster and reduce subvocalization too.
4. Read in [multiple words (single cohesive idea)](https://amzn.to/2ZyKArl)
   instead of one word at a time by grouping related words into a single idea or visual (e.g. super hero).

### #3 Prioritization

[Prioritize](https://www.ctl.life/2018/03/too-many-things-to-do-5-simple-steps-to.html) work based on their value and
work on the most valuable things first as time is limited, so you can get the most bang for your time.

For projects, use **TBD** to enable prioritization to maximize business impact:

* **Timeline Expectation** from stakeholders so projects are done on time.
* **Business Value** if the project is completed. Work on the highest value over cost ratio first!
* **Deliverables** for scoping the output to estimate effort and to align with stakeholders.

For meetings, attend only if you are providing/getting value and there is no way to do the same offline.

### #4 Optimal Concentration

[Pomodoro](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-019/) can be used to ensure concentration is at max when doing
work. Your ability to concentrate wanes after 30 minutes, so the idea is to take a break after 25 minutes of
concentrated work to reset using a timer. Instead of a timer, alternatively, use mindfulness to check your
concentration and mental/body energy once awhile and take a break/refuel when it is not 100%. Be sure to drink plenty of
water and snack on some brain foods!

### #5 Optimal Experience

[Flow](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-020/) can be used to fully immerse yourself in your work with
absolute passion and concentration, the work becomes so fun that time simply flies as your productivity sky rockets
to new heights!! This is the pinnacle of productivity and the final state that you want to achieve to get things done
fast with high quality!

To get into the state, these conditions must be met (**FGCT**):
* **Feedbacks**: There should be immediate positive feedback to your brain from what you are doing, so it
 would want to continue to get more of it, and eventually leading to flow state.
* **Goal**: There must be a clear goal in mind, otherwise the mind would wander. The more specific the better.
* **Challenging**: The work should be challenging, but not too hard. Too easy, then there is no need for flow state.
 Too hard, then it won't flow. There is a sweet spot somewhere. If the challenge is too hard, break it down into
 something easier. If it is too easy, well, find something more challenging to do, LOL!
* **Time**: It takes about 15 to 45 minutes of concentrated work to get into the flow state, so don't
 let yourself be distracted during that time. The use of Pomodoro timer is fine, but can be skipped after you get
 into or if it affects your flow state.

Listening to your favorite music can help too.

### #6 Behavior Design

[Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg, PhD](https://amzn.to/37YyHyK) can be used to build good habits to automate your life, which
can be used to improve your health and learning.

Easily create new habits using **ABC**:
* **Anchor**: Find something that you already do
* **Behavior**: Do something small that you want to become a habit
* **Celebrate**: Generate a good feeling and praise yourself.

For example, to build a habit of doing exercise in the morning after you get a drink of water (something you already
do), then immediately do something small towards your exercise goals (such as putting on shoes or taking one step),
and finally make yourself feel good and praise yourself for completing the small step. Repeat the same process
several times, and it will become a tiny habit. Repeat it to do more each time, then it can become a big habit.

Use **B=MAP** (Behavior = Motivation * Ability * Prompt) to easily change an existing one. Want to reduce picking up
your phone to check msgs? Make it harder to access your phone (reduce ability).

### #7 Public Speaking

[3 golden rules](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20121022044446-22330283-from-crickets-chirping-to-a-standing-ovation-three-rules-of-effective-public-speaking/) from Jeff Weiner:

* **Know your audience**: Different audiences have different goals and the content needs to be relevant and valuable to
  them.
* **Know your material**: The reason they are listening to you is because you know about the topic more than them,
  otherwise there is no reason for them to be there.
* **Know your passion**: The most interesting topic presented without enthusiasm will put people to sleep. The most
  boring topic will come alive when presented and infused with passion as it is transferred to your audience.

[Speak using **HAIL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI) (by Julian Treasure) so people will listen:

* **Honesty**: The truth matters and lies don't.
* **Authenticity**: Be yourself as they came to hear from **you**.
* **Integrity**: Do what you say otherwise they will feel betrayed
* **Love**: Show that you care and they will care about what you say

### #8 Parallel Thinking

[Six Thinking Hats by Edward de Bono](https://amzn.to/2YYdkLd) will help you or your team solve problems using parallel
thinking from six perspectives, thereby increasing the number of solutions and concensus in half the time or less:

1. **White**: Discuss using *pure* facts and information.
2. **Red**: Discuss using intuition and feelings, like *anger*. It's ok to be illogical.
3. **Black**: Discuss *negatively* with caution.
4. **Yellow**: Discuss positively with optimism like a ray of *sunshine*.
5. **Green**: Discuss using creativity, innovation, and new ideas with *growth* mindset.
6. **Blue**: Control the discussion and look at everything from the *sky* above. Start and end with blue.

Together, each person should put on each hat in the same sequence to brainstorm so the collective brain power of the
team can be used to solve the problem rather than arguing about who is right / better.

### #9 Hacking Motivation

When you feel motivated, that is actually dopamine being released, which makes you feel really good and happy. In order
to [hack it to your advantage](https://medium.com/@ozandagdeviren/hacking-your-brain-to-use-dopamine-for-success-ed2d352b4874),
there are a couple of things to keep in mind:

1. There must be a future reward that you are excited about. The amount of dopamine released when you receive the
   reward is significantly lower than before. This is the carrot. E.g. big paycheck.
2. Once you start doing work while thinking about the reward, that's when significant amount of dopamine is released,
   which gives you the motivation needed to get the work done. And it will continue to do so until the work is done, and
   then dramatically decreases until the reward is received.
3. To get an extra boost of dopamine, give yourself mini-rewards once awhile, but not always, which is less effective.
4. Many factors could significantly impact dopamine release or its effect, such as stress, pain, lack of sleep.

Your brain naturally trains you to do things that it thinks will help you live a better life by releasing dopamine, such
as making friends. Now you know how you can train your brain to do what you want!

Trainings
---------

Use these techniques/tips to improve your body, concentration, awareness, compassion, gratitude, and reduce negativities
(e.g. stress, anger), which will greatly improve your physical / mental health, memorization, execution, relationships,
leadership, happiness, and productivity!

Yep, meditation and exercise can do miracles for your body and mind! So don't underestimate their benefits and do
start doing them today.

### #1 Concentration Meditation

[Concentration Meditation](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-Concentration-Meditation) will improve your concentration and
reduce stress, therefore improving your memory, execution, and health.

Sit/lay down in a comfortable spot, relax your body, and focus on your breath or anything else as long
as it doesn't change. If any thoughts or other distractions comes up, just gently let them go and return to the
object of focus -- this is natural and will always happen, so no need to fight it. It takes time to master this
skill.

### #2 Mindfulness Meditation

[Mindfulness Meditation](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-Mindful-Meditation) will improve your awareness, concentration,
and reduce stress, therefore improving your ability to perceive, understand, and enjoy life.

Either sit/lay down in a comfortable spot or while you do things during the day in any position, relax yourself, and
bring your focus to what you are doing to fully enjoy it and then diffuse the focus to everything around you to fully
take them in and appreciate the beauty. Shift your focus to your different senses so you don't miss anything. For any
emotion or thought that comes up, enjoy, accept, let them go and don't let them affect you. Scan your body from top
to bottom once awhile to feel the sensations, relax, and put them into the correct posture. This can be done while
you exercise, sitting in front of your desk while working, walking to the bathroom, etc. You will start to see the
world anew and notice things that was once ignored.

### #3 Loving-Kindness Meditation

[Loving-Kindess Meditation](https://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Loving-Kindness-Meditation-%28Metta%29) will improve
your compassion, gratitude, concentration, and reduce negativities, therefore improving your relationships,
leadership, and happiness.

Sit/lay down in a comfortable spot, relax your body, and acknowledge that you are a person and you deserve to be
happy just like everyone else, forgive yourself for any wrongdoing, praise yourself for the good things you have
done, thank yourself for what you contribute to others, and finally extend agape and well wishes to yourself. Now
repeat the same steps for some people you love, some you had conflicts with, and some that you don't know that well.

### #4 Exercise

Do cardio exercises for at least 30 minutes a day to boost your happiness, mental and physical health, improve brain
functions and memory, sleep, energy levels, and [many more](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise),
therefore productivity too. Just walking can [improve working memory and increase creativity by 60%](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/153-3-kwik-tips-for-brain-exercise/id1208024744?i=1000456008448)!

As you age, you naturally become less active and many parts of your body start to degrade, hence it becomes more
critical to do exercise. When you exercise, it increases the amount of blood and oxygen to your brain to boost its
energy and function, and at the same time, remove toxins that damages your body and brain.
It can [slow down and even reverse some effects of aging](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercise-and-aging-can-you-walk-away-from-father-time)!

Don't like to exercise? No problem. Easily make it into a habit using [Tiny Habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8).

Leaderships
-----------

There is only so much you can do by yourself. With leadership, you can easily multiple your impact by 10 to **billions of
times** by inspiring others to join your mission.

### #1 Transcendence

There are many leadership styles, but the best one is
[transcendent leadership](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2018/05/01/how-to-stop-being-a-boss-and-become-a-transcendent-leader)
where you instill meaning and purpose to your employees based on the company's mission [with compassion](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/linkedin-ceo-how-compassion-can-build-a-better-company/)
so they will care about you, the company, the company's mission, and do amazing things.

[Fred Kofman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkofman/)'s book [The Meaning Revolution](https://amzn.to/3fWHQL9) details how
transcendent leadership can be used to manage these 4 key issues in an organization:

1. **Disengagement**: 90% of the global workforce is disengaged, which means a lot of lost productivity, money being
   dropped on the floor, and no one is picking it up. Traditional leadership, like the carrots and sticks approach,
   just demotivates employees and makes things worst, but many leaders still use it. To really motivate employees, there
   must be *purpose* to provide meaning, *principles* to ensure integrity, *people* to build safe/good relationships, and
   *autonomy* to enable creative freedom.
2. **Disorganization**: Different business units are fighting with others to win, but the organization is always loosing
   in that kind of situation. Local and global incentives can't solve the problems and sometimes can make things worst
   (i.e. only local incentives is ok but not enough).
3. **Disinformation**: Different people / teams have different information and they are not always willing to share. Even
   if they do try, it is still easy to misinterpret. In short, it's just almost impossible to have all perfect
   information to make the best decision.
4. **Disillusion**: If you talk and forget to walk, that can easily lead to disengagement.
   It's important to enable employees to provide honest feedbacks to leadership so improvement can be made. And power
   can be addictive and ruin you if it isn't put in check.

All organizations have those problems and there is no way to fix them completely, but you just need to manage them
better than your competitors using a well designed culture, compassion, and transcendent leadership.

If you feel the need to micromanage, that means you haven't put transcendent leadership to good use yet!

This is practiced by [Jeff Weiner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08/), one of the world's best CEOs, leaders at
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/) and [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/) as [Fred
Kofman was the VP of Leadership Development](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fkofman/) at both companies.

P.S. If you want a coaching session for these skills/techniques, please let me know. I would love to help you double your
happiness and productivity!

### #2 Network

Does a tree make a sound when it falls in the forest when no one is there? Technically, yes, but the idea is that if no
one is there, then it doesn't matter. Same applies to your career or personal mission. If no one is there to see what
you do, then nothing really happened from other people's perspective even if something did. Therefore, the more people
that can see and help you, the larger your impact. So go out and build your professional and personal network! The
bigger the better -- just make sure there's value on both sides for a long lasting relationship.

Your network can provide you with new opportunities -- my last 3 jobs were based on my connections' recommendations. It
can provide you with professional/personal development and knowledge sharing -- this is highly under valued. As others
are happy to share and there are no limits, it is the best and largest economy of value exchange where you can take as
much as you want without a need to give back -- you should be thankful, of course. However, if you do want to give back,
it is definitely appreciated. Everyone wins no matter what!

As LinkedIn's cofounder [Reid Hoffman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reidhoffman/) always say,
[relationships matter](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20121106193412-1213-why-relationships-matter-i-to-the-we/).
